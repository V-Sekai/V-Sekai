Implement \"An Algorithm for Triangulating Multiple 3D Polygons\"\n1. Use Godot's delaunay tetrahedralize https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/96d7bc62af25b85b8b9cc091eeea1e7a784ba624/core/math/delaunay_3d.h#L145 `static Vector<OutputSimplex> tetrahedralize(const Vector<Vector3> &p_points)`\n1. Emilie Yu described a method for smoothing meshes.\n\nLibigl should be best for smoothing while pinning the boundaries. I see they have a solver that can take fixed boundary constraints https://libigl.github.io/tutorial/#quadratic-energy-minimization so that could allow you to pin the boundaries. So instead of this line it would be something like\n\n```c++\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_data mqwf;\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_precompute(S, [flat vector of indices of boundary vertices size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero matrix], true, mqwf);\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_solve(mqwf, M * U, [flat vector of boundary vertices positions size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero vector], Z);\n```\n\nand the `vector Z is a (3 * N) flat vector` of the solution vertices (equivalent to the \"U\" of the other example). \n1. ??? Add remeshing.\n1. Expose a function to Godot Engine called triangulate boundaries.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Jeana demonstrated the feel of CASSIE on 2021-11-05 to draw a cat.\n\n![20211105 CASSIE Jeana](https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-proposals/blob/master/docs/decisions/attachments/20211105-CASSIE-Jeana.jpg?raw=true)\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Adding complexity and maybe time space explosions because of mesh processing.\n- May cause stuttering in VR.\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Integrate drawing like OpenBrush. https://github.com/icosa-gallery/open-brush\n- Rejection Reason: The feel is not the same.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a trivial gdscript and has performance gaps.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nIt is cool and I know how to approach implementing CASSIE in Godot Engine.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/zoum/projects/TriMultPoly\n- https://em-yu.github.io/\n- https://ns.inria.fr/d3/CASSIE\n- https://libigl.github.io/\n- https://github.com/godotengine/\n- https://www.blender.org/\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
