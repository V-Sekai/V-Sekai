<p>When you first start up the application, you will see a loading screen. This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.</p>
<p>When switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one–you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.</p>
<p>You click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.</p>

<pre><code>Able to mask loading times
Able to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai</code></pre>
<p>For style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.</p>

<section id="negative-consequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<pre><code>coordinating cats</code></pre>
<p>The drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.</p>
<p>It makes for a far less friction-less experience</p>
<p>But again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional</p>
<p>We could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn’t happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.</p>

<p>Open Metaverse Interoperability Group’s mission: We bolster the metaverse as an open and interoperable resource for anyone, inspired by the collaborative efforts of the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. Aside from technical work, OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds. OMI Core Values</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.</p>
<p>We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent.</p>
<p>We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation.</p>
<p>We empower the people making the metaverse.</p>
<p>We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.</p>

<p>Compile uro. You will need Elixir installed.</p>
<p>I recommend getting the latest, but for these steps, I am using Elixir v1.14.4.</p>
<p>Download Uro from https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro</p>
<p>We are using the dev environment. It is the default, but you can also set <code>MIX_ENV=dev</code>.</p>
<p>To compile HTML/CSS webpack:</p>
<pre><code>cd assets
npm install
npm run deploy
cd ..</code></pre>
<p>If the compile gives issues, you can run it multiple times. To compile dependencies:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">mix</span> do compile, phx.digest</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If one of them gives an error due to <code>nmake</code> or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a <code>x64 Native Tools command prompt</code> from visual studio and run <code>mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir</code></p>
<p>Finally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">mix</span> ecto.create</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">mix</span> ecto.migrate</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">iex.bat</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--werl</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-S</span> mix phx.server</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will start uro at http://localhost:4000/</p>
<p>Create a user in the website register user page.</p>
<p>Go to the console and set the user to be admin.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">iex.bat</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--werl</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-S</span> mix phx.server</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># </span><span class="al" style="color: #AD0000;">TODO</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># Call Uro.Accounts.update_user_as_admin</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro">GitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir …</a></p>
<p>The docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.</p>
<p>Then, go to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).</p>
<p>Now, edit the flux config at https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.</p>
<p>Check that uro-deployment was updated.</p>

<!-- Describe the problem or limitation you are having in your project. You may want to articulate the problem in the form of a question. -->
<p>We want to prepare godot-vrm for asset library publishing, but the format for publishing is incompatible with development.</p>

<p>We convert godot-vrm into a format suitable for development and then write a converter to a format ready for the asset library.</p>

<p>How to migrate to Godot-VRM to submodule format?</p>
<p>The thing Lyuma got blocked on is that VRM contains two addons: VRM and Godot-MToon-Shader</p>
<p>Revive the Godot-MToon-Shader repository which Lyuma previously archived.</p>
<p>But Lyuma will change it so it’s only the submodule (contents of the addons folder) and then Lyuma will make the Godot VRM addon (submodule) a branch in the godot-vrm repository</p>
<p>Then we’ll make a script to sync the changes to/from the godot-vrm example project which we submit to asset lib</p>
<p>Writing this up for Fire, since we talked about the issue with addons/vrm being duplicated in multiple projects since Godot Asset Library doesn’t allow submodules / raw addons folders.</p>
<p>Did some unarchiving and renames so that https://github.com/V-Sekai/Godot-MToon-Shader gets the top google slot</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure the godot-vrm code is synced up with other repositories where it was duplicated.</li>
<li>Make a mtoon addon repository with a copy of the Godot-MToon-Shader code.</li>
<li>Make a branch in godot-vrm with ONLY the 4.0 vrm addon, usable as a submodule.</li>
<li>Change v-sekai-game and other similar projects to use Godot-MToon-Shader and vrm as a submodules</li>
<li>Write a script to sync up repository contents from one to the other.</li>
</ol>
<section id="is_empty" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is_empty">is_empty()</h3>
<p>Is there a functional difference between <code>if not stringvar.is_empty():</code> vs <code>if stringvar != "":</code> x != “” is a bit shorter and easier to type, but I noticed some recommendation to use is_empty().</p>
