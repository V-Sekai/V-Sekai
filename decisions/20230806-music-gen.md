# Generating Music with Computer Assistance

## Problem Statement

The goal is to generate music with computer assistance.

## Proposed Solution

A potential solution is to use .ABC files, which have been successful in generating outputs with ChatGPT. These files also contain data in the header section like the key signature, tempo, and time signature, which can be added to the prompt.

Alternatively, you could ask ChatGPT to write a script for you. For instance, you could request a Python script that writes the chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes in a convenient output format like Lilypond or MusicXML.

```python
# Sample Python script to generate chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes
def generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals():
    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']
    intervals = []

    for i in range(len(notes)):
        seventh_interval = (i + 10) % len(notes)
        intervals.append((notes[i], notes[seventh_interval]))

    return intervals

print(generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals())
```

ChatGPT can also generate Lilypond syntax, which might be another viable solution.

## Positive Consequences

- This approach will allow for easier generation of music.
- It will bypass the limitations posed by the complex structure of MusicXML.

## Negative Consequences

- There may be some wrinkles when using ChatGPT to generate Lilypond syntax.
- Training small transformers to output syntactically correct .ABC files might pose a challenge.
