### Context and Problem Statement

We want to make procedural geometry.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Make maps and characters procedurally due to cost or scope limits.

Use blender geometry nodes.

### Positive Consequences

Most scope can be accomplished per unit of work.

Less quality due to procedural techniques.

- Do everything individually.

Not a few lines of code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?
