Networking is hard, storage creation is hard and the number of steps is not split between config and install.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nGravity claims to be a easy to prepare system for preinstalled and airgapped Kubernetes systems.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nCreate a prototype for a toy problem.\n\nThe toy problem is serving the shader motion html/js static website as a Kubernetes application.\n\nEvaluate the complexity.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Increase quality of life\n- Easier distributon\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Another layer of complexity\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nKubernetes is a massive project.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is an attempt to use off the shelf tooling.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://gravitational.com/\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
