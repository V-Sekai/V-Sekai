<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-backdrop">The Backdrop</h2>
<p>Ubisoft’s mixer broadcaster code has been the only available solution for handling multiplayer Blender. However, it has its limitations when it comes to scalability and real-time performance. This proposal aims to rewrite the code using Elixir and the Membrane Framework.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>The main challenge is to translate the existing code into Elixir while maintaining the functionality and improving upon the limitations of the current system. This includes ensuring that the new code can handle larger volumes of users and provide real-time updates without lag or delay.</p>
</section>
<section id="strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
<pre class="mermaid"><code>graph LR
  A[Ubisoft's Mixer Broadcaster Code] --&gt; B[Elixir &amp; Membrane Framework Code]
  C[No Authentication] --&gt; D[GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login]
  E[No Database] --&gt; F[Khepri Database Library]</code></pre>
<p>This strategy leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework’s unique features, uses the Khepri database library for data management, and implements GitHub login using OAuth 2.0 protocol for single sign-on.</p>
<p>Here are the key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Codebase</strong>: Transition from Ubisoft’s Mixer Broadcaster Code to Elixir &amp; Membrane Framework Code, tracked in a version control system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dependencies</strong>: Declare and isolate dependencies explicitly, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Config</strong>: Store configuration (including GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login credentials) in the environment, not in the code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backing Services</strong>: Replace in-memory data persistence with Khepri Database Library, attached as a backing service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build, Release, Run</strong>: Strictly separate these stages, facilitated by the Elixir &amp; Membrane Framework Code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Processes</strong>: Execute application as one or more stateless processes, storing needed state in the Khepri database.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port Binding</strong>: Export services via port binding, making the application self-contained.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Concurrency</strong>: Scale out the application via the process model, allowing for handling increased load.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disposability</strong>: Aim for fast startup and graceful shutdown to maximize robustness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dev/Prod Parity</strong>: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logs</strong>: Treat logs as event streams, handled by the executing environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Admin Processes</strong>: Run any needed one-off administrative tasks in an identical environment as the regular long-running processes of the app.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-upside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-upside">The Upside</h2>
<p>By rewriting the code in Elixir, using the Membrane Framework, and implementing the Khepri database library, we can expect improved scalability and real-time performance.

Additionally, the fault-tolerance feature of Elixir will ensure that the system remains operational even when errors occur.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-downside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-downside">The Downside</h2>
<p>Rewriting the code will require time and resources. There may also be a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Elixir, the Membrane Framework, and the Khepri database library.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-road-not-taken" class="level2">

<h1>Transitioning to Membrane Framework Pipelines with JSON-RPC Blender Runner</h1>
<section id="metadata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: Proposed</li>
<li><strong>Deciders</strong>: V-Sekai<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong>: V-Sekai, Elixir, Membrane Framework, Multiplayer Blender, JSON-RPC</li>

</section>
<section id="backdrop" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="backdrop">Backdrop</h2>
<p>The current solution for handling multiplayer Blender has its limitations when it comes to scalability and real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose a new approach that leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework. This will involve rewriting the code and introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner.</p>
<section id="character-posing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="character-posing">Character Posing</h3>
<p>In this new approach, character posing will be handled in real-time and shared across multiple clients. This means that any changes made to a 3D model by one user will be immediately reflected on all other connected clients. This feature will enhance the collaborative experience and allow users to interact with the same 3D models simultaneously.</p>
</section>
<section id="world-sharing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="world-sharing">World Sharing</h3>
<p>The state of the world, including objects, lighting, camera position, etc., will also be synchronized across all clients. This ensures that all users are experiencing the same environment, further enhancing the sense of immersion and collaboration.</p>
</section>
<section id="procedural-generation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedural-generation">Procedural Generation</h3>
<p>We will introduce procedural generation techniques to create unique and dynamic environments. These generated worlds will be shared across all clients, ensuring that each user’s experience is not only immersive but also unique and engaging.</p>
</section>
<section id="grease-pencil-sharing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grease-pencil-sharing">Grease Pencil Sharing</h3>
<p>Any drawings or annotations made using the Grease Pencil tool will be visible to all clients. This allows for collaborative sketching and planning, making it easier for teams to communicate their ideas visually.</p>
</section>
<section id="json-rpc-blender-runner" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="json-rpc-blender-runner">JSON-RPC Blender Runner</h3>
<p>To facilitate efficient communication with Blender, we’ll implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner. This will allow us to send commands to Blender and receive responses in a structured and standardized format. This feature will streamline the process of interacting with Blender, making it more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
<p>By implementing these features, we aim to improve the scalability and real-time performance of our multiplayer Blender solution. This will lead to a more immersive and collaborative experience for our users.</p>

<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-backdrop">The Backdrop</h2>
<p>The V-Sekai source code tree has been broken due to an unsuccessful merge. This has resulted in a halt in the development process, causing delays in project timelines.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>The main challenge is to unmerge the broken tree and then successfully merge it again. This requires careful analysis of the code and understanding the root cause of the initial failed merge.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>
<p>We use a tool called Git Assembly which makes reapplying branches on master easy. Here’s the strategy:</p>
<ol type="1">

<h1>Constrain the entire Godot Humanoid Skeleton</h1>
<section id="metadata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> proposed</li>
<li><strong>Deciders:</strong> V-Sekai, fire</li>
<li><strong>Tags:</strong> V-Sekai</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-backdrop" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-backdrop">The Backdrop</h2>
<p>The current Godot humanoid skeleton system lacks proper constraints for all bones, specifically in terms of rotation swing and rotation twist limits. This has led to issues when trying to move parts of the skeleton such as the head or legs towards the torso.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>The challenge lies in implementing these constraints without causing other issues within the system. Some bones are not solved and should not be constrained, adding complexity to the task.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>
<p>The strategy is to carefully analyze each bone and determine the appropriate constraints. This will involve a combination of swing rotation and twist rotation constraints, depending on the specific bone.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-upside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-upside">The Upside</h2>
<p>By implementing these constraints, we can improve the functionality and reliability of the Godot humanoid skeleton system. This will allow for more realistic movements and prevent system errors when moving certain parts of the skeleton.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-downside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-downside">The Downside</h2>
<p>There may be potential challenges in implementing these constraints, particularly for the unsolved bones. It will require careful testing and adjustment to ensure that the new constraints do not introduce new issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-road-not-taken" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-road-not-taken">The Road Not Taken</h2>
<p>An alternative would be to leave the system as it is, accepting its limitations. However, this would mean missing out on the potential improvements that could be achieved through this proposal.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-infrequent-use-case" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-infrequent-use-case">The Infrequent Use Case</h2>
<p>In some rare cases, the lack of constraints might actually be beneficial, allowing for unusual or exaggerated movements. These cases will need to be considered and potentially addressed separately.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-core-and-done-by-us" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-core-and-done-by-us">In Core and Done by Us?</h2>
<p>Yes, this change would be implemented in the core system by the V-Sekai team.</p>

<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>Using the reverse reporting style in game development, the project manager gets the most important information first, followed by supporting details.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>
<section id="punch-line" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="punch-line">1. Punch Line</h3>
<p>This is where you present the facts related to the game development process. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb1-1">"The AI behavior for enemy characters wasn't completed on time, and we didn't start the level design for Stage 3 as planned."</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb2-1">"Completed the character modeling as scheduled."</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="current-status" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-status">2. Current Status</h3>
<p>In this step, you explain how the punch line affects the game development project. For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb3-1">"Because of the incomplete AI behavior, the game testing has been delayed by a week."</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">3. Next Steps</h3>
<p>Here, you propose solutions to the problem if there are any. An example could be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb4-1">"I will be able to complete the AI behavior in the next four days but the level design for Stage 3 will still be behind schedule."</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
<section id="explanation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explanation">4. Explanation</h3>
<p>Finally, you provide the reasons behind the punch line. This is where you can give a detailed account of why things happened the way they did. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb5-1">"Three days' delay in AI behavior is due to an unexpected bug in the pathfinding system, and the remaining delay is due to being called to assist the graphics team with texture optimization."</span></code></pre></div>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-upside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-upside">The Upside</h2>
<p>The upside of this strategy is that it allows for clear and concise communication within the team. It ensures that everyone is aware of the current status of the project and what needs to be done moving forward.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-downside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-downside">The Downside</h2>
<p>The downside is that it requires all team members to be diligent in their reporting. If someone fails to accurately report their progress or issues, it could lead to miscommunication and delays in the project.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-road-not-taken" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-road-not-taken">The Road Not Taken</h2>
<p>An alternative approach could have been to use traditional reporting methods, where each team member provides a detailed report of their work. However, this method can often lead to information overload and important details may get lost in the process.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-infrequent-use-case" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-infrequent-use-case">The Infrequent Use Case</h2>
<p>This strategy may not be as effective in smaller teams or projects where communication is more direct and less formal.</p>

<p>We are developing a VR game that MUST be compatible with a wide range of devices. Our goal is to make our VR game accessible and enjoyable for this vast majority of users.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

</section>
<section id="the-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>
<p>We considered two options: Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices and Navmesh and 3D navigation points. We chose the “Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices” because it addresses the core issue of ensuring compatibility with iPads and large projector screens, and it is more cost-effective.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-upside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-upside">The Upside</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved user experience across different devices and screen sizes.</li>

</section>
<section id="the-road-not-taken" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-road-not-taken">The Road Not Taken</h2>
<p>Navmeshes and 3D Navigation Points are tools used to define traversable spaces in a 3D environment. However, they might not be suitable when the spaces aren’t already defined, such as grids. Waypoints have similar limitations.</p>
<p>In Godot, any modification triggers a rebuild of the entire navigation map. If the map is large and complex, this rebuilding process can take a significant amount of time and lead to performance issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-infrequent-use-case" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-infrequent-use-case">The Infrequent Use Case</h2>
<p>While Navmesh and 3D Navigation Points provide an intuitive user interface for navigating 3D spaces, they might not translate well to continuous interaction on touchscreens, which is often expected by users on such devices.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-core-and-done-by-us" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-core-and-done-by-us">In Core and Done by Us?</h2>

<p>As we navigate the 21st century, technology has become an inseparable part of our existence. It’s been making waves in the realm of music too. One such wave is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to craft melodies. This blueprint proposes a method for creating music using computer algorithms.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>The mission is to create music using computer programs.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>
<p>One promising strategy is to employ .ABC files. These files have proven effective in generating outputs with AI models like GPT-3. The .ABC files carry data in the header section, such as the key signature, tempo, and time signature, which can be incorporated into the prompt.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could leverage AI models to script for us. For instance, we could ask for a Python script that composes the chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes. The output format could be something user-friendly like Lilypond or MusicXML.</p>
<p>Here’s a sneak peek at a Python script:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;

<p>Another feasible strategy might be to use AI models to generate Lilypond syntax. Lilypond is a robust and adaptable tool for engraving tasks of all kinds, including sheet music, complex notation, vocal music, etc. Here is an example of a simple Lilypond syntax:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode lilypond code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode lilypond"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<span id="cb2-4"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>V-Sekai is exploring options to improve its backend services hosting and development. The goal is to find a system that can offer scalability, ease of deployment, and efficient resource management.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>One potential solution could be <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/">Dokku</a>, a Docker-powered mini-Heroku. Dokku provides a platform that could potentially meet our needs for building, deploying and managing applications effectively.</p>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>If Dokku were chosen, the implementation would involve setting up a Dokku server, migrating existing services, and training the team on how to use Dokku for development and deployment.</p>

</section>
<section id="potential-benefits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potential-benefits">Potential Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Dokku has features that could allow us to scale our applications based on demand.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Deployment</strong>: Dokku’s git-based deployment system might simplify the process of deploying new versions of our applications.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option Graveyard</h2>
<p>Other options considered include traditional VM-based hosting and other PaaS solutions like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. These options have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages that need to be weighed against those of Dokku.</p>

<h1>Git Subrepo Addon Management</h1>
<section id="context-and-problem-statement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>We are currently managing separate repositories for each addon in the V-Sekai game. This has led to difficulties in synchronizing updates and maintaining consistency across different components of the project.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>We propose to continue maintaining separate repositories for each addon, but use Git subrepo to merge them into the main V-Sekai game repository. This would result in the following structure:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;

<span id="cb1-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">│</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">└───addons</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4">    <span class="ex" style="color: null;

font-style: inherit;">)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    <span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">│</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    <span class="ex" style="color: null;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This way, all addons will be part of the main game repository but can still be managed independently.</p>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation will involve the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Changes are made in the respective addon repositories.</li>
<li>These changes are then merged into the main V-Sekai game repository using Git subrepo.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ensures that the addons remain up-to-date with their respective repositories.</p>
</section>
<section id="positive-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Streamlined workflow for managing addons.</li>
<li>Easier synchronization of updates across different components of the project.</li>
<li>Reduced complexity in project management.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial setup may require some time and effort.</li>
<li>Developers will need to adapt to the new workflow.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h2>
<p>Previously, we considered maintaining separate repositories for each addon without using Git subrepo. However, this approach was discarded due to the difficulties in synchronizing updates and maintaining consistency across different components of the project.</p>

<p>No, this enhancement is fundamental to the project structure and cannot be worked around with a few lines of script.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-a-reason-why-this-should-be-core-and-done-by-us">Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?</h2>
<p>Yes, this change affects the core structure of our project and should therefore be implemented by us to ensure consistency and control over the project.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>We want a robust character controller through V-Sekai renik, but we’re working on an abstract many bone ik and there wasn’t visible progress. The current approach is not yielding the desired results and is proving to be inefficient.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Pause many bone ik and update renik to use many bone ik technologies. This would involve refactoring the existing codebase to integrate the many bone ik technologies directly into the renik solution.</p>

<h1>Enhancing the Many Bone IK Configuration</h1>

</section>
<section id="context-and-problem-statement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>We have identified a limitation in the V-Sekai platform where there are too many variables to pose the kusudama constraints on the desktop. We propose to overcome this limitation by introducing a VR mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Our solution involves creating a VR mode specifically for posing Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. The steps for implementation are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Take an off the shelf VR controller.</li>
<li>Take an off the shelf multiplayer functionality.</li>
<li>Develop a tool selection ui. Collaborate with guillefix.</li>
<li>Adjust the kusudama constraint attributes to match posing.</li>
<li>Save attributes.</li>
</ol>
<section id="definition-of-a-kusudama" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definition-of-a-kusudama">Definition of a Kusudama</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a ball. There are two ways you can move it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Twist</strong>: Like spinning a globe on its stand.</li>
<li><strong>Swing</strong>: Like moving your finger from one spot to another on the ball.</li>
</ol>
<p>Think of a Kusudama (a type of origami that forms a sphere) as an example for the swing movement. The pieces of paper move just like your finger would on the ball.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Investigate Saracen’s VR networking prototype.</li>
<li>Rebuild character posing without tracking the physical sensors</li>
<li>Apply Many Bone IK tracking</li>
<li>Rotation swing (10x Vector4)</li>
<li>Rotation twist (From and range)</li>
<li>Adjust for quality</li>
<li>Complete configuration</li>
</ol>
<p>Assigning physical sensors to IK points is non-goal.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option Graveyard</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Desktop Mode Enhancement:</strong> Initially, we considered enhancing the desktop mode to handle the kusudama constraints better. However, this option was discarded due to the inherent limitations of the desktop interface for such complex interactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use of External Tools:</strong> Another option was to use external tools or plugins specifically designed for handling Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. This option was rejected because it would require users to learn and manage additional software, which could lead to a fragmented user experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplified Kusudama Constraints:</strong> We also thought about simplifying the kusudama constraints to make them more manageable on the desktop. But this option was discarded as it would limit the capabilities and flexibility that our platform currently offers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automated Posing:</strong> An automated system for posing the kusudama constraints was also considered. However, this option was rejected because it would take away control from the users, potentially leading to less satisfactory results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tutorials and Guides:</strong> Providing extensive tutorials and guides to help users navigate the complexity of posing kusudama constraints on the desktop was another option. This was discarded because it doesn’t address the core issue - the difficulty of managing these constraints on a desktop interface.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Increased complexity in game development.</li>
<li>Potential need for more resources (time, manpower, etc.) for implementation and testing.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard-1" class="level2">

<p>Posing the avatar is the first interaction a user has when entering our virtual world, V-Sekai. This underlines the necessity of investing in this enhancement to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience right from their first interaction with our platform.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-a-reason-why-this-should-be-core-and-done-by-us">Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?</h2>
<p>Pose quality is crucial to us. As the creators of V-Sekai, we have an unparalleled understanding of our platform’s limitations and potential improvements. This insight puts us in a unique position to enhance the pose quality in a way that aligns with our users’ needs and expectations. Therefore, it is essential that we undertake this enhancement.</p>

</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>We propose to use khepri for sidekick server data with an elixir frontend.</p>

<p>V-Sekai currently has limitations when it comes to creating avatars with specific features and customizations. This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Here is a list of raw processes to be broken down.</p>
<section id="to-create-a-source-filter-sink-pipeline-system-for-this-project-we-can-use-the-following-mime-labels" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-create-a-source-filter-sink-pipeline-system-for-this-project-we-can-use-the-following-mime-labels">To create a source, filter, sink pipeline system for this project, we can use the following mime labels:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Source: The source will provide the initial avatar model and any additional assets required. The input mime type for the source could be <code>application/gltf+json</code> or <code>model/gltf+json</code> if the avatar is in GLTF format, or <code>image/png</code> or <code>image/svg+xml</code> if the avatar is provided as a 2D image.</p></li>
<li><p>Filter: The filter will handle all the customization steps mentioned above. It will take the input from the source and apply the necessary modifications to create the desired avatar. The input mime type for the filter would be the same as the output mime type of the source, depending on whether the avatar is in GLTF format or represented as an image.</p></li>
<li><p>Sink: The sink will receive the customized avatar from the filter and store it as the final output. For this project, the sink should support both PNG and SVG images for 2D avatars, and GLTF for 3D avatars. Therefore, the output mime types for the sink would be <code>image/png</code> or <code>image/svg+xml</code> for 2D avatars, and <code>application/gltf+json</code> or <code>model/gltf+json</code> for 3D avatars.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: To avoid lossy formats, we are using PNG or SVG for 2D images and GLTF for 3D formats. PNG and SVG are lossless image formats, while GLTF is a lossless 3D format that preserves the fidelity of the avatar model.</p>
