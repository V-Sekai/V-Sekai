### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

Login to v-sekai from the command line

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Provide a stable way to storing tokens.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

When a player wants to upload a packed scene they need to login.

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: Do nothing.
- Why: We will need to open the editor to upload.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a uiux thing.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We own the editor flow.
