Create a wrapper for https://github.com/infosia/vmc2bvh/tree/master/osc\n2. Install Blender addon https://github.com/maybites/blender.NodeOSC\n3. Convert python script to c++\n4. Make c++ buildable by bazel\n5. Build executables on Github Actions\n\n#### Design loop\n\n1. https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11 for command line parsing\n2. https://github.com/infosia/vmc2bvh/blob/master/code/Vmc2Bvh.cpp for example code\n3. For each process send osc to node osc (Blender).\n4. Create a structure for the messages\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nML and armature work is hard\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\n[Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?]\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\nFrom Kendrick\n\n* [media_pipe_demo.zip](https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-proposals/files/6972400/media_pipe_demo.zip)\n* https://github.com/V-Sekai/game-tools-V-Sekai\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
