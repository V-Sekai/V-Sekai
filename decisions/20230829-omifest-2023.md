## Context

### The Backdrop

OMIFest 2023 is set against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. As virtual reality and augmented reality technologies become more accessible, there's an increasing need for platforms that allow artists, tinkerers, hackers, players, and professionals to showcase their talents and collaborate.

### The Challenge

The challenge is to create an event that not only celebrates these individuals but also encourages conversation and collaboration within our community. We aim to build a webpage on the OMI website for more information and updates about this event.

## Decision

### The Strategy

Our strategy is to host a series of monthly events leading up to the main event in October 2024. Each month we will focus on different aspects of the event, such as building the vehicle, avatars, textures, scenery, and workshops on content creation.

### The Upside

The upside of this event is that it provides a platform for individuals from various backgrounds to showcase their talents, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects. It also helps in promoting the use of VR/AR technologies and encourages innovation in this field.

### The Downside

The downside could be the potential logistical challenges involved in organizing such a large-scale event. There might also be issues related to ensuring fair participation and dealing with intellectual property rights.

### The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could have been to organize smaller, more frequent events throughout the year. However, we decided to go with a larger annual event to create more impact and allow participants enough time to prepare.

### The Infrequent Use Case

While the event is designed to cater to a wide range of participants, there might be some who might not be able to participate due to lack of access to necessary technology or skills. We plan to address this by providing resources and learning materials to help them get started.

### In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, the event is being organized by us, OMIGroup, in collaboration with V-Sekai. We are responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing aspects of the event. The success of such a large-scale event relies on the collective efforts of many individuals and organizations.
