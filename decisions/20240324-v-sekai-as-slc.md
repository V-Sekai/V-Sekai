# Suggestion: Implementing V-Sekai Using the SLC Framework

## Background

The VR gaming landscape necessitates a seamless and inviting experience. A VR dating game can leverage this by adhering to principles of simplicity, engagement, and completeness.

## Issue

The difficulty lies in crafting a VR dating game that is easy for beginners, engaging enough to retain users, and offers a comprehensive set of features from the get-go without depending on future updates or add-ons.

## Plan

By employing the SLC framework—Simple, Lovable, Complete—the project should:

- **Simple:** Prioritize user-friendly design with straightforward instructions and effortless navigation.

  ```pseudo
  function interact_with_object(object):
      if object.is_interactable:
          show_prompt("Press X to interact")
          wait_for_input()
          execute_interaction()
  ```

- **Lovable:** Develop attractive characters and environments that augment the virtual dating experience.

- **Complete:** Debut with an exhaustive set of features such as varied scenarios and detailed character interactions.

  ```yaml
  launch_features:
    - CompleteCharacterCustomization
    - DiverseScenarios
    - InDepthCharacterInteractions
    - RealTimeChat
  ```

## Advantages

This strategy guarantees a product that's accessible, enthralling, and fulfilling without the necessity for immediate expansion, appealing to a broad audience.

## Drawbacks

A more thorough initial development phase might postpone the release, and a focus on simplicity could potentially restrict advanced functionalities.

## Alternative Strategy

Choosing a leaner initial version could permit an earlier release but might also risk alienating early adopters if their expectations are not met.

## Infrequent Users Consideration

Design a user-friendly re-engagement process ensuring that returning users can easily pick up where they left off and understand new features.

## Development Approach

Concentrate on core features crucial at launch, with the potential to expand based on user feedback.

## Current Status
