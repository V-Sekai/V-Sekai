## Context and Problem Statement

We are facing a limitation in the metaverse usage due to lack of realtime voice conversion support. This issue is causing difficulties in real-time communication and interaction.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to use SoftVC VITS, a fork of so-vits-svc that adds realtime voice conversion support and an improved interface. It will involve installing the package, using its GUI or CLI for voice conversion, and training the system for better results.

## Implementation

The implementation of this solution will require the following resources, time, and steps:

1. Install the package using pip:

```python
pip install -U so-vits-svc-fork
```

2. Use the GUI or CLI for voice conversion.
3. Train the system for better results.

## Positive Consequences

- The solution will resolve the current limitation by providing realtime voice conversion support.
- It will improve the overall user experience in the metaverse.

## Negative Consequences

- Potential challenges could include the need for regular updates to get the latest features and fixes.

## Option Graveyard

This section includes options that were considered but ultimately discarded. These include:

1. Using other voice conversion tools without real-time support.
2. Developing a new tool from scratch.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, this enhancement cannot be worked around with a few lines of script as it involves complex voice conversion processes.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

To be determined.
