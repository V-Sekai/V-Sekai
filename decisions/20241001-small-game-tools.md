# Proposed: Small V-Sekai Creation Tools

## The Context

The Godot Editor now integrates a 2D editor on a screen for VR, which cannot be fully optimized for VR screens like the Meta Quest 3. However, the Quest 3's multiwindow support offers new possibilities.

## The Problem Statement

We want to create a suite of tools for V-Sekai game development that leverages the capabilities of current hardware without requiring full VR integration.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Develop a series of small, efficient tools that can connect remotely to the V-Sekai game project, facilitating world creation and other development tasks from a 2D interface displayed within a VR environment.

## The Benefits

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Developers can use tools within a VR environment without the need for full VR tool conversion, combining comfort with functionality.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Enables immediate feedback and interaction with the game world, enhancing development speed and efficiency.
- **Innovative Approach**: By using a hybrid approach, V-Sekai remains at the cutting edge, integrating new technologies while maintaining usability.

## The Downsides

- **Technical Challenges**: Creating tools that function seamlessly between 2D and VR environments is complex and may require significant resources.
- **User Adaptation**: There might be a learning curve as developers adjust to using a 2D interface in a VR context.
- **Hardware Limitations**: The performance and functionality are still bound by the limitations of existing VR hardware like the Meta Quest 3.

## The Road Not Taken

Full VR development tools and augmented reality interfaces were considered but deemed not yet viable for our goals due to current technological constraints and development focus.

## The Infrequent Use Case

For developers who prefer traditional desktop-based environments, or where VR integration provides no clear advantage, existing non-VR tools will continue to be supported and developed.

## In Core and Done by Us

This initiative aligns with our core mission to innovate within accessible VR and game development tools, and will be developed internally by the V-Sekai team.
