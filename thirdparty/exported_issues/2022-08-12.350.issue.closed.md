### Context and Problem Statement

For 3D Metaverse Games, gltf import in Godot Engine is bulky sized, not optimal and has no constraints.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We call gltfpack in Godot Engine.


### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We assume the most complicated type of model which is a character with animations.

Execute a pipeline via gltfpack according to our settings.

Do not use these conflicting extensions:

* KHR_draco_mesh_compression
* KHR_mesh_quantization

### Positive Consequences

1. Would be able to reduce Godot Engine gltf size and ensure uniform blender export.
1. Positive collaboration with other developers that can use this.
1. We can filter Blender's output.
2. This enables gltf basisu for portable textures on multiplatforms and with opencl gpu accelerated encoding.
3. Externally compiled programs such as gltfpack can have different options like opencl and different simd flags.
1. Enables gltf pack's mesh optimization aka the EXT_meshopt_compression 
1. We can also generate reports for constraints like how many triangles.
2. Requires making gltfpack not drop extras and extensions.
1. Requires EXT_meshopt_compression in Godot Engine
1. Requires KHR_texture_basisu in Godot Engine

### Negative Consequences

1. Lacking opencl might be too slow.
4. Targets that don't use EXT_meshopt_compression will need to implement or decompress.

### Option graveyard

1. Doing Blender export / import manually

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No. It is a workflow integration.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I know how to do it. This can benefit multiple groups.
