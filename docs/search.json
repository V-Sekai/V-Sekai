The Material Blender Addon output is to textures of the FBX / GLTF2 format. We can later output glTFs with the MaterialX as an glTF2 extension.\n2021-04-30 06:47:12Z fire: Lyuma — MaterialX in glTF would allow for a generalization of “KHR_materials_variants” extension - in other words, MaterialX would allow for character or object customization to textures baked at load time\n2021-04-30 06:06:58Z fire: Made a proposal for GLTF2 to include MaterialX in three stages. A stage 0 extension where it replaces png and a stage 1 extension that replaces gltf variants for parameters, stage 2 would be adding arbitrary graphs as parameters.\n2021-04-30 06:06:21Z fire: Made a prototype that exposes HTC Facial tracker to Godot Engine as a GDNative plugin for 3.x. https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vive-pro-eye\n2021-04-29 17:36:43Z fire: “Design Approved; Needs Proposal from Juan: Play scheduled notes/metronome https://gist.github.com/fire/b9ed7853e7be24ab1d5355ef01f46bf1 (https://youtu.be/JEIb0jXcDPA?list=PLQfcaH6N9nlotFGh4WLbGIFf2ijwzA9W1&t=63 example use case; replicate this ability (to have time stamps on which we play an audio clip)) Postponed Discussion: Modular audio system (like JACK) godot#35613 Interest: Integrate interactive music PR godot#32769 Interest: Discuss audio stream graph Approved: Onboarding for newcomers to the audio side of Godot development Interest: Godot Audio Graph:\n\nbetter reuse of mixing/effect chains\nbetter interaction with areas 2d/3d (currently we have just Areas linked to a bus) Interest: Pure-Data Audio Graph”\n\n2021-04-29 01:56:06Z fire: Arguing in OMI about materialx, usdz and wasm\n2021-04-28 23:31:24Z lyuma: and the fix is restart the editor, or you have to go and edit every script in the project and undo\n2021-04-28 23:31:13Z lyuma: we need to report a bug when something fails to parse on project load, it says something like can’t load this script because it’s not loaded\n2021-04-28 19:52:25Z fire: Lyuma will make a const bool variable in vrm import to not create the .res because it is big and affects git storage.\n2021-04-28 18:24:26Z fire: Did some spring cleaning of my https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-hop-spin-dance.

It of course needs proper robust testing (we’ll organize something to try and break the security), but I consider it mostly done. Some remaining issues: ensuring mesh and colliders are not on reserved layers, exposing more things as value tracks, exposing more canvas UI elements, better error reporting, checking for cyclic node dependencies, checking entity ‘model’ scenes, properly embedding 3D canvas data on exporter, properly embedding model resources, enabling checks only for web scenes. 👍 (1)\n2021-05-24 15:37:50Z fire: (blender)\n2021-05-24 15:37:37Z fire: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/703726244436508722/846370817701183488/unknown.png 👍 (2)\n2021-05-24 15:37:09Z fire: Worked with hutty to transfer gltf export tech to his voxel drawing tool\n2021-05-24 00:56:09Z fire: Also, pitching usdz after 4.0\n2021-05-24 00:55:22Z fire: “Trying to pitch a list of features for funding. - Full glTF2 / VRM import and export pipeline in Godot Engine\nGeneral purpose retargeting system for VRM type models + encoding in BVH (3d pose format)\nGodot Engine support for basis universal in glTF2\nQuads in glTF2\nAfter quads in glTF2, better mesh simplification and LODs that work on quads”\n2021-05-22 16:23:18Z fire: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47764/files Lod Merge! 👏 (4)\n2021-05-22 03:41:06Z lyuma: is it GLES2 or GLES3?\n2021-05-22 03:12:33Z fire: humbletim https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/845499351346315264/unknown.png\n2021-05-22 02:30:08Z fire: Investigating V-Sekai compiled for javascript\n2021-05-21 23:38:30Z fire: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/845445481622667304/unknown.png\n2021-05-21 23:32:27Z fire: What do I do, Victoria Day on Monday.

I think we’re going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.\n\nRadical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.\nAdd BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.\nMeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints?

It’s really exciting to get this much imported with just a couple clicks and about 30 seconds of waiting\n2021-05-13 21:37:01Z lyuma: it’s a bit of random chance that it looks so similar: the skydome and some objects like flowers have completely custom shaders, so those will have to be ported manually\n2021-05-13 21:36:32Z Saracen: This is actually starting to look like the original now\n2021-05-13 21:36:27Z Saracen: Woah!\n2021-05-13 21:36:04Z lyuma: Unidot Importer: Got lighting and basic environment settings importing.

Good job! It’s now possible to use avatars with in-between bones.\n2021-05-13 03:00:37Z Saracen: Basically, the new code to automatically assign the next bone in the chain assumed the skeleton was assigned, even though it can be null.\n2021-05-13 02:55:04Z MMMaellon#2053 whoa wait why was it crashing\n2021-05-13 02:47:41Z Saracen: Fixed RenIK crashing.\n2021-05-13 00:48:18Z fire: Reviewed https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46568.

Since Godot has no means for preserving the original filename on import when the files are not present, doing a fix to the FBX2glTF tool won’t quite cover my necessary usecase, so I think extracting the map in the tooling is easiest.

    "text": "14.2 2022-04-05\nLyuma\nMade a lot of progress towards animation import in Unidot. Godot’s node system means that some paths become different: for example, meshes have to be reparented to skeletons; or extra levels in the hierarchy to keep track of physics bodies.\nTo this end, it is now keeping a lookup dictionary from path and component to fileID (which can be mapped to Godot node) which means animation support should be close.\n(Also, they made a major change to the import system in 2019 which affects id numbering. Still working on it)\nPushed a major update to Unidot, mostly in the post_import script. It should now generate paths much more accurately to the original file, and implemented the hashing algorithm used by Unity 2019 for file ID generation, for example generating ids like 919132149155446097 for the root object.\nThis has fixed some assets exported from Unity 2019 like below, which used to fail to resolve the fileIDs for meshes! @iFire\nMade some progress with terrain import in Unidot. It will import textures, normalmaps and splatmaps (creating an appropriate ShaderMaterial). My plan is to implement trees and grass using MultimeshInstance objects. With this I also now support texture assets. Texture Arrays seem to fail internally. Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn’t implemented on Godot’s end, but we’ll get there…\nperformance-wise, I think it’s now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I’m using tristrips so it’s mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development. (if you’re interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general)\nTerrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.\nI also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don’t understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I’d rather work on something else."

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" >> \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n17.3.11.2 Upgrading fedora\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n17.3.11.3 Upgrading nginx and cert-manager\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n17.3.11.4 Upgrading k3s\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n17.3.11.5 Upgrading cockroachdb\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this. Copy the first two numbers from the CockroachDB CCL line. In this case, 20.2\n#\n# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.\n# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.\n# To exit, type: \\q.\n#\n# Server version: CockroachDB CCL v20.2.2 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nReplace some.version in the following command with the value we found above:\nSET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.preserve_downgrade_option = 'some.version';\nFinally, perform the upgrade:\nsudo kubectl delete job cockroachdb-init\nsudo helm upgrade cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl delete pods/cockroachdb-client-secure\nsudo kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml"

    "text": "20.2 Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nAs indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network."

    "text": "20.3 Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n20.3.1 A. Spawning\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n20.3.2 B. Consistent References\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n20.3.3 C. State Synchronization\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n20.3.4 D. Standard Interaction Protocols\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n20.3.5 E. Network Security Model:\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n20.3.6 F. Inter-entity Isolation\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n20.3.7 G. Abstraction\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n20.3.8 H. Physics\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n20.3.9 Spawn Type (i). Map builtins\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n20.3.10 Spawn Type (ii). Map spawns\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n20.3.11 Spawn Type (iii). Avatar spawns\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n20.3.12 Notes about Entity parenting:\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity."

Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\nhttps://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\nhttps://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\nhttps://baserow.io/\nhttps://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n\n\n39.0.9 Derivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Why keep a changelog?\n\n\nTo make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project. Who needs a changelog?\n\n\nPeople do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what’s in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.\n\n\n\n79.0.3 Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nKeep a changelog.\n\nUse the https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-proposals #repository as a placeholder.\nDelay migrations to main project #repository to a later date.\n\n\n\n79.0.4 If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot code.\n\n\n79.0.5 Positive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\n79.0.6 Negative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\n79.0.7 Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe are the best to know what changed.\n\n\n79.0.8 References\n\nhttps://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/\n\n\n\n79.0.9 Derivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\n98.0.4 If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\n98.0.5 Positive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\n98.0.6 Negative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\n98.0.7 Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\n98.0.8 References\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\n98.0.9 Derivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

So instead of this line it would be something like\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_data mqwf;\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_precompute(S, [flat vector of indices of boundary vertices size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero matrix], true, mqwf);\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_solve(mqwf, M * U, [flat vector of boundary vertices positions size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero vector], Z);\nand the vector Z is a (3 * N) flat vector of the solution vertices (equivalent to the “U” of the other example).\n\n???

    "text": "136.2 Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nhumbletim, codefloof, iFire and lyuma debated the meaningfulness of building Gltf extensions.\niFire constructed an argument we are making a Gltf container for the metaverse. A metaverse container where each part is separated because of limited engineering bandwidth. We brought up the point Gltf isn’t unknown and is unknown.\nLyuma can’t entirely agree that Gltf extensions are “separated.” Gltf extensions are independent extensions that are good from an engineering perspective.\nLyuma reaffirmed his suspicions that OMI standards are not so valuable in isolation. Humbletim raised valid concerns that the Unity work had not progressed, and Mozilla Hubs had not merged the OMI audio emitter code. We may need Unity platforms and Mozilla Hubs to bootstrap the ecosystem, but tools like Gltf transform could sidestep it.\niFire also constructed a strawman of how operating inside a platform is seamless, and transferring between platforms is like pulling teeth. Still, a strawman isn’t something that helped facilitate the discussion so Lyuma may have misunderstood that part. iFire described the unity package vs others. Lyuma agrees that this is valid; other formats could be deemed “interoperable,” more expressive than Gltf.\nIn Lyuma’s mind, it’s a fair X point that already exists. So why work on Y? Why does Gltf 3d format if we have Fbx 3d format etc.?\nLyuma doesn’t think we need to assume that there must be only one standard.\nWe’re trying to see if we can do better by working together than taking some existing closed format and using it verbatim.\nOMI work is valid even if a unity package standard exists. We don’t need to be the only standard.\niFire didn’t exhaust all the details of the point, but we can make a Gltf transform for as many standards we can catalogue."

As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the “silhouette” of the model.\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can’t say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz’s idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage’s diagram.\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you’re going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\nfrom what I can understand, “2” is what Tokage is proposing. I don’t see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don’t see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n\n\n158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd\n\n\n\n\n\n153.0.6 Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee pull request.\n\n\n\n153.0.7 Positive Consequences\n\nSharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n\n\n153.0.8 Negative Consequences\n\nThe feature is hard to do.\n\n\n\n153.0.9 Option graveyard\n\nUse Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n\n\n153.0.10 If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n\n\n153.0.11 Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n\n\n153.0.12 References\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902\n\n\n\n153.0.13 License of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

Every prominent feature requires at least an introduction, so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.\nOn each page, we want to create a bullet list of all the things the user needs to learn to use the feature."

    "text": "A.1 An example topic\nLet’s take a topic, for example, Godot XR. The user will need to know:\n\nWhat is XR (we can link to a page or briefly explain it)\nWhat is Godot (if we have covered it already on the previous page, link to that page, and briefly re-explain, e.g. in one sentence)\nHow XR works in Godot and how our product uses it\nWhat people can achieve concretely with that [feature/knowledge on this page]\nWhat are limitations of the technology [that also affect our product]\n\nEach page’s draft should be a bullet list like this. Because then we or the writer instantly knows all the points the page must cover And it doesn’t take very long to write and review those bullet lists\nLast, for all the cases where the user has to follow steps (for example, using an interface), we need to detail each step with the most straightforward words possible. For instance, if they need to click on three buttons, we describe the steps with explicit mentions of the labels as seen in the UI and always use the same verbs, for example:"

In the right part of the window, the game’s window settings appear.\nScroll down to the resolution setting.\nClick the numbers to change the resolution. The values are in pixels.\n\nWhen we say reusing the verbs, it’s about being consistent, like:\n\nClick a button\nOpen a menu\nOpen a file\nNavigate to a tab\n\nIt doesn’t have to be 100% of the time the same but for instance, for buttons, click and press are well understood, but “use,” while correct, maybe a bit harder to parse\nAlso, changing the phrasing, style, and verbs used throughout our docs adds cognitive load.\nMaking things simple, explicit, and consistently allows users to focus on the steps and memorize new information."
