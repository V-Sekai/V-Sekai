### Context and Problem Statement

To present at various virtual market locations, we need to do various workflow steps that are quickly forgotten.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We can write down our collective workflows for creation.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Write a guide of our wisdom for making a 3d market booth.

## Tools used

1. Substance designer
2. Blender
3. `4m x 4m x 5m` standard size

## Initial task

1. Make a procedural grid texture and some text 
2. put it in blender on the booth boundaries (cube) 

## Storage

1. Upload to Github organization.


### Positive Consequences

1. Increase our workflow

### Negative Consequences

1. Loss of creativity

### Option graveyard

- Option: Recreate the workflow from scratch

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Workflow enhancement.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are doing this, so we can record how we did it.
