# VR MMOG Project Design

## 1. Introduction

The project is a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Game (VR MMOG). The game unfolds in an immersive dungeon-style setting where players can form teams or join squads for cooperative gameplay.

## 2. Squad-Based Gameplay and Command System

The game incorporates squad-based gameplay. Players form squads with a commander who oversees strategy, resource management, and tech upgrades. This system encourages strategic planning and effective resource management.

## 3. Player Experience

The game aims to create a cooperative environment that encourages teamwork and shared triumph over obstacles. 

## 4. Emphasis on Gadget Mechanics

Instead of having distinct classes, players will have access to various gadgets that enable them to perform a wide range of actions:

- **Object Manipulation**: Move objects around by blocking or pushing them.
- **Long-Range Targeting**: Aim at targets from far away.
- **Spell Casting**: Select and cast spells or buffs from a menu.

Each gadget corresponds to a specific skill, adding layers of strategy and complexity to the game.

## 5. Skill Gates

The game introduces "skill gates", checkpoints where players must demonstrate a specific skill they've learned to progress.

## 6. Level Design

The level design ensures that players gain necessary skills and abilities before facing major challenges.

## 7. Teamwork Over Solo Play

The game emphasizes teamwork over solo play. This reflects the cooperative nature of the game, where players often form parties or teams to overcome challenges together.

## 8. Custom Avatars and Voice Chat

Custom avatars and voice chat enhance the immersive experience, allowing players to express their individuality and communicate in real-time.
