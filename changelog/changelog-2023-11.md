# V-Sekai Changelog - November 2023

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Unidot now no longer depends on the post-import script after conversion is complete. This means the converted assets will work standalone without unidot importer with one exception\*.
- Supported asset types are listed in the readme, but basically it should support many types of meshes, animations, Standard shader materials, scenes/prefabs and physics objects.

### Changed

- Unidot is now considered to be in a beta / early RC for the first release.

### Fixed

- Not applicable for this month.

### Deprecated

- Not applicable for this month.

### Removed

- Not applicable for this month.

### Security

- Not applicable for this month.

This project does not adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Previous Releases]

- Not applicable for this month.

## Misc

- Shaders or MonoBehaviors/scripts are not currently supported. This will not be part of the initial release. The goal for now is scene / character / animation conversion.
- AnimationTree uses the standalone runtime/anim_tree.gd script as a blackboard system to simulate unity parameters. This file should remain.
