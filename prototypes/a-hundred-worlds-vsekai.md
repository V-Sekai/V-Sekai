# A Concept for V-Sekai

I've been contemplating an unconventional concept for V-Sekai. The idea revolves around the creation of not just one or two, but a hundred interactive worlds from me!

Drawing inspiration from VRChat, which boasts millions of such interactive environments, I believe it's feasible to create a hundred of my own.

The challenge lies not in the quantity but in the quality and interactivity of these worlds. However, with the right amount of dedication and creativity, I am confident that this ambitious project can be realized.
