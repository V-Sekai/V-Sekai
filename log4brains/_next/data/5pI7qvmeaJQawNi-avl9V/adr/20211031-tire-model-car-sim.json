While citing their mit license.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nUse math model.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nOne does not simply make a vehicle sim.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nMaybe out of scope? But I have an approach.\n\n### References\n\n> #########################################\n> Tire Modeling\n> #########################################\n> \n> The default tire model employed by PhysX vehicles is discussed in Appendix H of the CarSimEd documentation:\n> \n>     http://www.eggert.highpeakpress.com/ME485/Docs/CarSimEd.pdf\n> \n> PhysX vehicles allow any tire model to be simulated by specifying a tire shader, as discussed in :ref:`Tire Shaders`.
