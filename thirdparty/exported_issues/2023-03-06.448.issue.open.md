### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

We want to have user scripting in the godot web platform so v-sekai is more accessible.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Expose the wasm implementation in libsql t

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Modify the scons to build for the web
2. Modify the build to compile rust for the web

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

Do nothing.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Implementing wasm is non trivial.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We want to have user scripting.
