# V-Sekai has spatialised audio and VOIP support

V-Sekai spatialised audio and VOIP support is in prototype phase as Oct 2022

V-Sekai has spatialized audio, which means that you’ll be able to hear sounds coming from the direction they would be in real life. For example, if you see someone across the room talking to you, they will sound like they’re over there.
