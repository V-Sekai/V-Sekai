### Context and Problem Statement

Avatars may be imported wrong.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Create a checklist for developers and players.

Look at NASA's workmanship guides.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. check if eye movement is correct
3. Head camera is not intersecting the body.

### Positive Consequences

Avoid uncanny valley avatars.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature.

People aren't opening the application. There is not a problem mentioned by users so will work on the features first.
