### Context and Problem Statement

Currently, the https://github.com/V-Sekai/avatar_vr_demo has two pairs of hands and a head.

I want to test humanoid avatars.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Add Liqu https://booth.pm/ja/items/1148939 to test humanoid characters.

The license appears to be compatible.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Adding Liqu as a VRM and as a gltf (a vrm but exported as a gltf).

Further proposals will talk about renik, manyboneik, skeletonik3d usage.

### Positive Consequences

1. We can test bone rolls, unlike xbot.
2. The graphical load is similar to the avatars I've seen.
3. Has vrm spring bones.

### Negative Consequences

1. makes the repository bigger.

### Option graveyard

- Option: Use xbot
- Rejection reason: We can't use xbot because it doesn't show bone roll and other errors easily. Xbot is also very simple and doesn't represent the typical avatar.

- Option: Use robbie
- Rejection reason: We can't use robbie because it's not rigged for VR.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a content decision.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are writing the avatar VR demo.

> Original Character - Hibitsune Liqu (響狐 リク)
> A wolf girl who loves to DJ.
> 
> 3D avatar made with VRChat usage in mind.

> 
> Hibitsune Liqu is a character that supports creative works and virtual bishoujo incarnation (バ美肉) so her model is available free of charge.
> She can also be used in games and videos. This content can also be monetized.
> If you share your creation with me on Twitter, I will like and retweet it!
> 
> 
> If you liked this model, I will gladly accept any donations as support!
