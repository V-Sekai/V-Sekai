1. The virtual reality prototype should have a minimum of 1000 networked physics cube objects.

2. The virtual reality prototype should include four players with 3D avatars.

3. The virtual reality prototype should allow the player to use their hands to manipulate the cube objects, as well as other gestures such as pointing, grabbing, and throwing.
