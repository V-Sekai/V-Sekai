# PROPOSAL V-Sekai Core Features 

(written with chat bot assistance)

1. Voice and text chat enable open communication, the basis for connection in VR.   

2. VRM 1.0 avatars provide pre-built and custom options. Avatars convey identity and build empathy.   

3. Casual collaboration spaces offer simple meeting spaces. Keep minimal and flexible.

4. 3D doodling/modeling tools sketch, draw and model for spontaneous co-creation in VR. Balance freedom and precision through stroke neatening and curve/surface changes. Transform sketches to concept models for design, with freehand feel.

The goal is enabling natural connections through conversation, shared spaces and open-ended co-creation or play. New features come from participation, feedback and connections in this open ecosystem.

## Rationale:

1. Voice and text chat is the most fundamental feature that enables open communication and connection between users in the VR space. Without this, none of the other features would function or have purpose.   

2. Avatars represent the user's identity and enable empathy by giving users an embodiment in the virtual space. This comes after communication as a key part of social interaction and co-presence.

3. Casual collaboration spaces build on communication and avatars by providing a flexible space for users to meet and interact. However, they rely on the prior features to function.  

4. 3D doodling and modeling tools enable co-creation and open-ended play, but rely on all the previous features like communication, avatars and collaboration spaces to be useful and meaningful. They represent an optional additional layer of interaction built on the core foundations.

So in summary, the features can be seen as progressively building on each other, with communication and avatars providing the basis, collaboration spaces enabling simple shared interactions, and 3D tools supporting more open-ended co-creation - all aimed at enabling natural connections in the virtual space.
