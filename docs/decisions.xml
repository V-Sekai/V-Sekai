<h1>Wasm in V-Sekai Proposal</h1>
<section id="metadata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li>Status: proposed</li>
<li>Deciders: V-Sekai, fire</li>
<li>Tags: V-Sekai</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="context-and-problem-statement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>V-Sekai aims to provide a high-performance platform for virtual worlds and avatar-based social games. The current implementation relies on GDScript or C++ native modules, which may not offer the desired performance, user agency, complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>V-Sekai utilizes WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance performance, offering an alternative to GDScript.</p>
<section id="ownership" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ownership">Ownership</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core modules: Owned by V-Sekai</li>
<li>Custom modules: Owned by users</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="security" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="security">Security</h3>
<p>User-uploaded Wasm modules undergo a two-step process for safety and unauthorized access prevention:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Ensure module structure and integrity adhere to security standards.</li>
<li><strong>Sandboxing</strong>: Confine modules in a secure environment, restricting system resource access and mitigating potential harm.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="functionality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="functionality">Functionality</h3>
<p>Wasm modules facilitate advanced functions in virtual worlds and avatar-based social games, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient character animations</li>
<li>Interactive environments</li>
<li>Real-time multiplayer networking</li>
<li>Immersive gameplay experiences</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Using <code>MissingNode</code> in this design is essential because it provides a placeholder for nodes that are not yet available or implemented in the <code>godot-wasm</code> environment. This can be particularly useful when working with WebAssembly in Godot Engine, where certain features or nodes might not be supported or fully implemented.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why using <code>MissingNode</code> is beneficial:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Graceful degradation</strong>: When a node type is not supported or not yet implemented in the <code>godot-wasm</code> environment, using <code>MissingNode</code> allows the application to continue running without crashing or encountering errors. It acts as a fallback mechanism, ensuring that the rest of the application can still function even if some nodes are missing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplified implementation</strong>: By using <code>MissingNode</code>, you can focus on implementing only the dependencies required for handling missing nodes, rather than implementing all possible node types. This reduces the complexity of your <code>godot-wasm</code> implementation and makes it easier to manage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easier debugging</strong>: When a <code>MissingNode</code> is encountered, it can provide information about the missing node type, making it easier to identify and fix issues related to unsupported or unimplemented nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: As new nodes are added to the Godot engine or support for existing nodes is improved in the <code>godot-wasm</code> environment, you can easily replace <code>MissingNode</code> instances with the actual nodes once they become available. This ensures that your application remains compatible with future updates and improvements to the Godot engine.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, using <code>MissingNode</code> in your design is essential to handle missing or not yet available nodes gracefully, simplify the <code>godot-wasm</code> implementation, make debugging easier, and ensure compatibility with future updates to the Godot engine.</p>
<p>The UGC (User-Generated Content) WASM modules, uploaded by users for universal access, are attached to a <code>MissingNode</code> as a script, providing property data and behavior. The clever implementation involves <code>MissingResource</code> for resources and a dictionary of <code>Variant</code> for node properties. Behavior is within the dictionary in this design. Utilizing Godot’s standard <code>set_script</code> property, WASM Godot only needs to implement dependencies for <code>MissingNode</code> and <code>MissingResource</code>, excluding components like <code>Node3D</code>.</p>

<section id="positive-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance for complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution</li>
<li>Greater user control over scripts and customization</li>
<li>Enhanced functionality for virtual worlds and avatar-based social games</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Potential security risks with user-uploaded Wasm modules</li>
<li>Increased complexity in implementation and maintenance</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Optimizing GDScript</strong>: Improving the performance of GDScript was considered, but it would not provide the same level of performance boost as WebAssembly.</li>
<li><strong>Using a different scripting language</strong>: Alternative scripting languages like Lua or Python were considered, but they also do not offer the desired performance improvements compared to WebAssembly.</li>
<li><strong>Native code integration</strong>: Integrating native code (C++, Rust, etc.) directly into V-Sekai was considered, but it would increase complexity and maintenance efforts. Additionally, it would not provide the same level of security and sandboxing as WebAssembly.</li>
</ol>

<li><p><strong>Manual integration of the PMX module</strong>: Instead of using <code>git subrepo</code>, manually copy and integrate the PMX module into the V-Sekai project. This option is less efficient and harder to maintain, as it requires manual updates and synchronization with the original PMX repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using Git Submodules</strong>: Use <code>git submodule</code> to include the PMX module in the V-Sekai project. While this approach allows for easier updates and maintenance, it can be more complex to set up and manage compared to <code>git subrepo</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating a separate plugin</strong>: Develop the PMX module as a standalone plugin that users can install and enable in their projects. This option reduces the complexity of the core V-Sekai project but may result in less seamless integration and increased setup effort for users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Forking the Godot Engine</strong>: Fork the entire Godot Engine and directly modify its source code to include the PMX module. This option is not recommended, as it would make it difficult to keep the fork updated with upstream changes and could lead to compatibility issues.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?</p>
</section>
<section id="describe-the-proposed-option-and-how-it-helps-to-overcome-the-problem-or-limitation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-the-proposed-option-and-how-it-helps-to-overcome-the-problem-or-limitation">Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation</h3>
<p>The proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-how-your-proposal-will-work-with-code-pseudo-code-mock-ups-or-diagrams">Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Head: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.</li>
<li>Left Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.</li>
<li>Right Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.</li>
<li>Hips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.</li>
<li>Left Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.</li>
<li>Right Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Chest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.</li>
<li>Left Elbow: Attach a tracker to the left elbow to monitor its angle, speed, and position. This helps improve the accuracy of tracking arm movements during activities like soccer and dancing.</li>
<li>Right Elbow: In the same way, place a tracker on the right elbow to keep track of its angle, speed, and position. This also enhances the precision of tracking arm movements in sports such as soccer and dance performances.</li>
</ol>
<p>By gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.</p>

<section id="positive-consequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Effective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.</li>
<li>The solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.</li>
<li>Flexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.</li>
<li>Potential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h3>
<p>Camera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.</p>
<p>Camera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.</p>

<p>V-Sekai is a project that aims to provide an immersive virtual world experience for users. As the project grows in complexity, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the system is thoroughly tested and can handle various scenarios. One of the challenges faced by the V-Sekai team is the lack of diverse and realistic data for testing purposes. This limitation hinders the ability to identify potential issues and optimize the system’s performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>To address the limitations in testing the V-Sekai system due to the lack of diverse and realistic data, this proposal suggests generating random text data for testing purposes.</p>
<section id="implementation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>We will use a tool like <a href="https://chancejs.com/">Chance.js library</a> to generate random text data for testing purposes and use the database.</p>
<section id="text-processing" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="text-processing">Text Processing</h4>
<p>For generating random sentences, we will use something like the following method:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb1-1">chance<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

</section>
<section id="database-operations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="database-operations">Database Operations</h4>
<p>We will perform the following SQL operations on the <code>user</code> and <code>chat</code> tables:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SELECT All Data in Table</li>
<li>SELECT LIKE Data based on %NA%</li>
<li>SELECT Specific Row Data</li>
<li>INSERT</li>
<li>UPDATE</li>
<li>DELETE</li>
</ol>
<section id="tables" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tables">Tables</h5>
<p><strong>Table user</strong></p>
<p>id | username | password | updated_on | created_on |</p>
<p><strong>Table chat</strong></p>

</section>
</section>
<section id="sql-function" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sql-function">SQL Function</h4>
<p>We will create a SQL function to check if the username/password match and return ‘OK’. We will also check if the query returned is ‘OK’ and add false information randomly in the nodes to signify a user doing invalid calls for production testing.</p>
<p>The implementation will generate 90 days of data, generating 100,000 text data entries for testing purposes.</p>

<p>There is no robust, and production quality inverse kinematic solver for full body tracking virtual reality tracking and other inverse kinematic uses like foot planting and hand grabbing.</p>
<p>In addition to the limitations of the current IK system due to its implementation as a SkeletonIK3D node, the IK system can be improved by reimplementing it as an animation node. This can address these limitations and improve the overall functionality.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reimplement the IK system as an animation node to gain better control over the processing order, ensure accurate pose states.</li>
<li>Reuse the track filtering code that exists in the AnimationTree system to enhance the new IK system’s capabilities.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>In order to improve the Inverse Kinematics (IK) system, we will replace SkeletonIK3D with a new custom AnimationNode called <code>IKAnimationNode</code>. This new node will ensure accurate pose states and provide precise control over the IK system.</p>
<p>To enhance the blending between animations and handle IK more efficiently, we will reuse track filtering code from the existing AnimationTree. This will allow for smoother transitions and better performance.</p>
<p>Next, we will implement the IK solver within the new <code>IKAnimationNode</code>. This solver will be responsible for calculating target positions and rotations for each bone in the skeleton.</p>
<p>After implementing the IK solver, we will update the AnimationTree to use the new <code>IKAnimationNode</code>. This will involve adding an empty track, reading from the transform’s position, and blending between different animations to create seamless motion.</p>
<p>As we develop this new IK system, it is crucial to address potential issues such as filter usability, duplicate subtrees versus multiple outputs, and designing a reasonable full body setup. This includes handling jumping and foot IK interactions with the ground.</p>
<p>Finally, we will test and optimize the new IK system to ensure correct functionality and optimal performance. This will result in a more robust and efficient IK solution for our animation needs.</p>

</section>
<section id="context-and-problem-statement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Dreadpon is working on a voice chat solution inside Godot 3.5.2 and found the jitter-buffer implementation in <a href="https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-speech">godot-speech</a> to be rudimentary. They are looking for an ideal jitter-buffer implementation that can handle both slowing down and speeding up played audio.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Use the adaptive jitter buffer from the Speex source code as a starting point, with modifications to address its limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Capture packets as they are being dropped from the jitter buffer.</li>
<li>Ensure all captured packets are played.</li>
<li>Implement a playback buffer to speed up the audio when necessary.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Integrate the adaptive jitter buffer from the Speex source code into the godot-speech project.</li>
<li>Modify the jitter buffer to capture dropped packets and store them in a separate buffer.</li>
<li>Implement a playback buffer that accelerates audio playback when more audio packets are available.</li>
<li>Test the new implementation to ensure it handles jitter compensation effectively.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="positive-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h2>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue using the current rudimentary jitter-buffer implementation in godot-speech.</li>
