We could make an API where someone or something can post a message displayed in Discord using curl or some command, though we would have to make sure this is locked behind a secret key. Unclear.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Grow the community\n- Help us manage the project\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Maintenence costs of having a service fed\n\n# Other proposal: Integration with Discord via Webhook\n\n## Positive Consequences\n\n- Lower maintenance burden\n\n## Negative Consequences\n\n- No access to commands or statuses. Only capable of posting messages.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nYes, it is possible to script querying the itch.io or Uro shards API. This proposal aims to make this information more accessible to those who would not script it.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need this to grow the community.\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
