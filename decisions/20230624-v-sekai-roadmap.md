### Context and Problem Statement

What is the V-Sekai Roadmap and Goals?

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

The roadmap presented here is short-term.

### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

By avoiding work on User Generated Content (UGC) and world building, we can prioritize the three main states in the roadmap: "World / Avatar Performance" (WAP), "Networking" (NET), and "UI/UX". This allows the team to focus on the core aspects of V-Sekai and achieve the goals more efficiently.

#### World / Avatar Performance (WAP)

1. **Research light assets**: Spend 4 hours researching suitable light assets for implementation.
2. **Async loading techniques**: Dedicate 4 hours to understanding and planning the integration of async loading techniques into the project.
3. **Modern rendering techniques**: Allocate 4 hours to investigate modern rendering techniques and high-performance libraries compatible with the current system.

#### Networking (NET)

1. **Data formats and compression analysis**: Use 4 hours to analyze existing data formats and compression algorithms, identifying areas for improvement.
2. **Refining IK points accuracy**: Spend 4 hours working on refining IK points accuracy.
3. **New technologies research**: Allocate 4 hours to research potential new technologies for evaluation and continuous improvement.

### Positive Consequences

- Easier creation of V-Sekai.
- Focused development on core aspects.

### Negative Consequences

- Potential overhead challenges.

### Option graveyard

- Waiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features.

### If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No. This is a process.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a core process for V-Sekai.
