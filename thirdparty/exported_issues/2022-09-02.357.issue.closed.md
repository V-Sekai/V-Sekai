### Context and Problem Statement

Some things require a more compatible Linux implementation.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Use the WSL Fedora remix Linux from `WhitewaterFoundry/Fedora-Remix-for-WSL`.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
* https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Fedora-Remix-for-WSL

Has built-in support for SystemD and for starting services wihtout launching SystemD via the wslsystemctl command.

Support for many Linux graphical applications with no need to configure display or libGL. Requires Windows 11.

1. `wsl --install`
2. Uninstall Ubuntu
3. Install Fedora Remix
4. `sudo dnf group install "GNOME"`
5. https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/compiling_for_linuxbsd.html
6. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_rpm


### Positive Consequences

1. Can do github pushes
8. CUDA compatibility
9. Closer to native work on uro.

### Negative Consequences

1. Not native linux.

### Option graveyard

Can't use full linux because of developer iteration times.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a guide.
