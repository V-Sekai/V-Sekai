### Context and Problem Statement

To test VRChat compatibility, we need to install VRChat, Unity, and its associated Univrm SDKs.

I'm also on Windows 10.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

The solution will be to document how to install the associated packages.


### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

Download Unity Hub from https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe.

unityhub://2018.4.20f1/008688490035

Must install Windows mono package and use Windows target platform.

To install a Unity Package go to Assets > Import Packages > Custom Package and select all the files in the dialog.

Install UniVRM from https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases/download/v0.64.0/UniVRM-0.64.0_920c.unitypackage.

VRMConverterForVRChat cares about UniVRM versions.

Install https://github.com/esperecyan/VRMConverterForVRChat/archive/refs/tags/v26.0.0.zip into the Assets folder.

Install https://github.com/esperecyan/UniVRMExtensions/archive/refs/tags/v1.6.2.zip into the Assets folder.

Install https://vrchat.com/home/download VRCHAT SDK3 for Avatar and Worlds.


Log in VRChat for upload. (There is a randomized waiting period.)

Restart Unity.

Drop the VRM character into the Characters folder inside of Assets.

Open the VRM character prefab and select the root node and then export as a VRChat Avatar.

Save the avatar to Assets/VRChat Character.


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is documentation and can be automated.

### Positive Consequences

- Improve interoperatibility
- Improve VRM standard

### Negative Consequences

- Complexity
- Blackbox design

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

No one seemed to document this.
