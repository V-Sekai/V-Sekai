What tools and techniques can we use?\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse AMDuProf\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nAMDuProf shows the slower functions and there's also a callgraph and flamegraph feature.\n\nA callgraph is similar to a stacktrace.\n\nA flamegraph is a way of visualizing performance. The first link is an ACM article describing the design.\n\nThe workflow is for each item start from the top and go down.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Works for both Intel and AMD\n- Works on Windows 10 and Linux\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Less usable than superluminal\n- Slower than superluminal\n\n## Option graveyard: same as above\n\n* Option: superluminal\n* Rejection reason: \n    * Not free\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot appliable.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nNot in code. This is documenting a technique.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2927301\n- https://superluminal.eu/\n- https://developer.amd.com/amd-uprof\n- http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
