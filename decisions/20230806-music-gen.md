# Sonic Symphony: An Exploration into AI-Driven Melody Creation

## Project Overview

- **Current Status:** Under Development
- **Project Leads:** V-Sekai, fire
- **Key Themes:** Music, AI, GPT-3, Python, Generation

## Setting the Stage

In the modern era, technology has become an integral part of our lives. Its influence is also being felt in the music industry, with artificial intelligence (AI) being used to create melodies. This project aims to explore the potential of using computer algorithms for music creation.

## The Task at Hand

The goal is to generate music through computer programming.

## Our Approach

One potential approach involves the use of .ABC files, which have shown promise when used with AI models like GPT-3. These files contain data such as key signature, tempo, and time signature in their header section, which can be utilized in the prompt.

Alternatively, we could utilize AI models to write scripts for us. For example, we could request a Python script that generates the chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes. The output could be in a user-friendly format like Lilypond or MusicXML.

Here's a glimpse of what a Python script might look like:

```python
def generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals():
    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']
    intervals = []

    for i in range(len(notes)):
        seventh_interval = (i + 10) % len(notes)
        intervals.append((notes[i], notes[seventh_interval]))

    return intervals

print(generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals())
```

Another possible approach could involve using AI models to generate Lilypond syntax. Lilypond is a versatile tool for engraving tasks of all kinds, including sheet music, complex notation, vocal music, etc. Here's an example of simple Lilypond syntax:

```lilypond
\relative c' {
  c4 d e f |
  g a b c |
}
```

This code will generate a sequence of eighth notes from C to C.

## Paths Explored and Abandoned

During our exploration, several paths were considered but ultimately abandoned for various reasons:

1. **Using MIDI files:** While MIDI files are commonly used for music creation, they were deemed too complex and challenging to craft programmatically.

2. **Using MusicXML:** Despite its comprehensive nature and wide support, MusicXML was discarded due to its intricate structure, making it difficult to craft programmatically.

3. **Using other music notation software:** Other software like Finale and Sibelius were considered but discarded due to their proprietary nature and lack of support for programmatic music generation.

## Potential Benefits

- This method could simplify the process of creating music.
- It could bypass the complexities associated with the structure of MusicXML.

## Potential Challenges

- There may be difficulties when using AI models to generate Lilypond syntax.
- Training smaller transformers to output syntactically correct .ABC files could be challenging.

### Guiding an AI Assistant to Write Magazine Articles

This guide offers tips on how to instruct an AI assistant like GPT-3 to write articles in a magazine style.

- Use an engaging title to attract readers.
- Briefly introduce the topic in an interesting opening paragraph.
- Break up sections with subheadings.
- Include quotes from interviews for added depth.
- Conclude with a summary and call to action.
- Use active voice and descriptive language.
- Adjust the tone to match the publication - serious, humorous, etc.
- Format drafts according to standard magazine article structure.
- Allow the AI some creative freedom in certain sections if suitable.
