# Proposed: Small V-Sekai Creation Tools

## The Context

The Godot Editor cannot be reasonably converted to VR screens for the Meta Quest 3.

Noticed that the Quest 3 has multiwindow support.

## The Problem Statement

We want a representation of tools for the V-Sekai game. It doesn't need to be in-VR.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Make a series of small tools that remote into the V-Sekai game project for world creation purposes.

## The Benefits

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Allows developers to work directly within their preferred environment, enhancing workflow and flexibility.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Facilitates real-time interaction and testing within the game environment, speeding up development cycles.
- **Innovative Approach**: Positions V-Sekai at the forefront of game development tools by integrating cutting-edge technology.

## The Downsides

- **Technical Challenges**: Developing stable and efficient tools can be technically challenging and resource-intensive.
- **User Adaptation**: Requires users to adapt to a new set of tools, which might have a learning curve.
- **Hardware Limitations**: While not as demanding as full VR tools, performance may still be limited by the capabilities of current hardware like the Meta Quest 3.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative methods such as full VR tools or augmented reality interfaces were considered but found less suitable for our current objectives.

## The Infrequent Use Case

For developers who prefer traditional non-VR development environments due to familiarity or specific technical requirements, traditional tools will still be necessary.

## In Core and Done by Us

This initiative is central to our mission of pioneering accessible, innovative game development tools and will be developed internally by the V-Sekai team.
