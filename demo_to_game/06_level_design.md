## 6. Level Design

The level design in the game plays a crucial role in ensuring that players acquire necessary skills and abilities before they encounter major challenges. This is achieved through various means:

The game's levels are designed with a **Progressive Difficulty** curve. This means that early levels are relatively easy, allowing players to learn the basic mechanics and controls of the game. As players progress, the levels become more challenging, requiring them to apply and refine the skills they've learned.

Each level often includes specific **Skill-Based Challenges** or obstacles that require certain skills to overcome. By strategically placing these challenges, the game ensures that players have had the opportunity to learn and practice these skills before they're needed for major challenges.

The level design also encourages **Rewarding Exploration**. Hidden areas or secret paths might contain power-ups or abilities that can help players in future challenges. This not only rewards curiosity but also ensures players are well-equipped for upcoming challenges.

Major challenges, such as **Boss Battles**, are typically placed at the end of levels or sections. These act as tests of the skills and abilities players have gained throughout the level. They provide a clear goal for players to strive towards and offer a satisfying conclusion to each level.
