### Context and Problem Statement

We desire portable content.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Create an art workflow. 

```nomnoml
[Open Spoke] -> [Spoke.glb]
[Spoke.glb] -> [Blender] 
[Blender] -> [OMI.glb]
```

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

**Flow**:

1. Spoke importer to Blender (collaborate with Mozilla Hubs team)
2. OMI importer to Blender

**Stretch Goal**: 

Support for extension data in Mixer blender

**Expected output**:

1. Blender Mozilla Hubs exporter PR for importing Spoke GLB
1. Import outdoor festival to Blender format from Spoke
2. Export/Import as OMI format in Blender

**List of components**:

- [ ] audio
- [ ] Spawn

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Interlapping projects are complicated.
