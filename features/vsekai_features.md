V-Sekai has added support for VRM avatar files, which are open-source standards for sharing portable humanoid avatars between different virtual reality platforms.

The addition of VRM support allows users all over the world to customize their avatars in V-Sekai by importing models made with Blender or VRoid Hub, then using them as their persona within this virtual space.
