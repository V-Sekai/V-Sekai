# V-Sekai Social VR

We're developing a free, open source virtual reality platform. We work to make it user-friendly and fulfill a need in the VR community. Join the [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org) team on the [V-Sekai discord server](https://discord.gg/7BQDHesck8)! 

V-Sekai means virtual world in Japanese.

## Collaborative

Social VR is our dream and we piggyback on thousands of Godot Engine contributors.

There have already been over 100+ V-Sekai PRs merged into the Godot Engine core.
