<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The problem of simulating audio reverb in Godot Engine 4 involves accurately modeling the way sound waves propagate, reflect, and interact within a given environment. This requires sampling a chaotic 7-dimensional space every frame, either through precomputation or real-time processing. The complexity arises from the fact that sound behaves more like light with intense diffraction, making it impossible to rasterize.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Implement Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs) for artificial reverberation. FDNs consist of multiple delay lines connected in a feedback loop with a mixing matrix. The output is a combination of the input signal and the delayed signals.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computational-and-io-complexity-an-example">Computational and I/O Complexity: An Example</h2>
<p>Let’s consider an example of implementing a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) for audio reverb simulation with 8 delay lines. We will analyze the computational and I/O complexity involved in this specific case.</p>
<section id="fdn-reverb-claims-may-need-to-be-verified" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fdn-reverb-claims-may-need-to-be-verified">FDN reverb claims may need to be verified</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>For a medium-quality reverb effect, let’s consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN.</li>
<li>For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.</li>
<li>Overall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.</li>
<li>In summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="computational-complexity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computational-complexity">Computational Complexity</h3>
<p>For a medium-quality reverb effect, let’s consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN. The main components contributing to the computational complexity are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Delay Lines</strong>: Each delay line requires memory for storing the delayed samples and computations for updating the delay buffer. For 8 delay lines, the complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matrix Mixing</strong>: The mixing matrix combines the outputs of the delay lines in a specific way to create the desired reverb effect. For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback and Input/Output Processing</strong>: Additional processing, such as filtering or gain adjustments, may be applied to the input, output, or feedback paths. This complexity depends on the specific filters or processing used but is generally proportional to the number of delay lines.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.</p>
</section>
<section id="io-complexity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="io-complexity">I/O Complexity</h3>
<p>The I/O complexity refers to the amount of data that needs to be read from and written to memory during the processing of the reverb effect. In the case of an FDN with 8 delay lines, the I/O complexity is mainly determined by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reading and Writing Delay Line Buffers</strong>: Each delay line requires reading and writing operations for updating the delay buffer. The I/O complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input and Output Audio Data</strong>: The audio input data must be read, processed, and combined with the output of the FDN to generate the final reverberated audio signal. The I/O complexity for input and output audio data is generally low compared to the delay line buffer operations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>The proposed solution involves using the T5 model to generate text based on input text and then converting the generated text into XState JSON format, all within the Godot Engine 4.0 environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>To use T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) with JSON-former for XState in Godot Engine 4.0, you’ll need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Load the necessary libraries</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="gd"><code>var transformers = preload("res://path/to/transformers.gd")
var torch = preload("res://path/to/torch.gd")</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Load the T5 model and tokenizer</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="gd"><code>var model_name = "t5-small"
var tokenizer = transformers.load_T5Tokenizer(model_name)
var model = transformers.load_T5ForConditionalGeneration(model_name)</code></pre>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Create a function to generate text using T5</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="gd"><code>func generate_text(input_text: String) -&gt; String:
    var input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text)
    var outputs = model.generate(input_ids)
    var generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
    return generated_text</code></pre>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Create a function to replace placeholders in T5 output</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="gd"><code>func replace_placeholders(text: String) -&gt; String:
    var formatted_text = text.replace("&lt;extra_id_0&gt;", "event").replace("&lt;extra_id_1&gt;", "state")
    return formatted_text</code></pre>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><strong>Create a function to parse JSON from formatted text</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="gd"><code>func parse_JSON(formatted_text: String) -&gt; Dictionary:
    var json_object = JSON.parse(formatted_text).result
    return json_object</code></pre>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><strong>Create a function to convert T5 output to XState JSON format</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="gd"><code>func t5_to_jsonformer_xstate(text: String) -&gt; Dictionary:
    var formatted_text = replace_placeholders(text)
    var json_object = parse_JSON(formatted_text)
    return json_object</code></pre>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><strong>Use the functions to generate XState JSON</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre class="gd"><code>func _ready():
    var input_text = "your input text here"
    var t5_output = generate_text(input_text)
    var xstate_json = t5_to_jsonformer_xstate(t5_output)
    print(xstate_json)</code></pre>
<p>This will give you the XState JSON format for the given input text. Note that the T5 model might need to be fine-tuned on a dataset specific to your use case to generate accurate XState JSON representations.</p>
</section>
<section id="positive-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automates the process of converting natural language text into XState JSON format within the Godot Engine 4.0 environment.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>The T5 model may require fine-tuning on a specific dataset to generate accurate XState JSON representations.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h2>
<p>Here are some option graveyard items for the proposal:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Using rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Easier to implement and understand.</li>
<li>No need for training data or fine-tuning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Limited in handling complex or ambiguous input text.</li>
<li>Requires manual updates to rules as new use cases emerge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Using other pre-trained NLP models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Can leverage existing state-of-the-art NLP models.</li>
<li>May provide better performance on certain tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>May require additional fine-tuning or adaptation for the specific task.</li>
<li>Some models may have higher computational requirements or costs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating a custom NLP model from scratch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Tailored specifically for the task of converting natural language text into XState JSON format.</li>
<li>Potential for better performance if designed well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Requires significant time and effort to develop, train, and maintain.</li>
<li>May not perform as well as existing state-of-the-art models.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Using an external API or service for natural language understanding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Offloads the complexity of NLP to an external service.</li>
<li>Can potentially leverage more advanced NLP techniques.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Introduces dependency on an external service.</li>
<li>May incur additional costs or usage limitations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These options were considered but ultimately discarded in favor of using the T5 model with JSON-former for XState in Godot Engine 4.0 due to its balance of performance, ease of implementation, and adaptability to the specific task.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>V-Sekai, an open-source virtual reality platform, aims to deliver a user-friendly experience for the VR community. To boost its functionality and compatibility with other tools, we propose integrating networked procedural generation as a sidecar to the Godot engine server, allowing for more dynamic and immersive environments in V-Sekai.</p>
<p>To further address V-Sekai’s limitations, we suggest incorporating the Membrane Framework along with other relevant technologies such as Godot Engine, OpenMfx Support, Elixir Phoenix, and Elixir Nx. This comprehensive integration will not only enhance V-Sekai’s capabilities but also increase its versatility across various use cases.</p>
<p>The implementation involves connecting V-Sekai with the components mentioned in the Membrane Framework diagram below:</p>

<p>By avoiding work on User Generated Content (UGC) and world building, we can prioritize the three main states in the roadmap: “World / Avatar Performance” (WAP), “Networking” (NET), and “UI/UX”. This allows the team to focus on the core aspects of V-Sekai and achieve the goals more efficiently.</p>

<h1>Wasm in V-Sekai Proposal</h1>
<section id="metadata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li>Status: proposed</li>
<li>Deciders: V-Sekai, fire</li>
<li>Tags: V-Sekai</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="context-and-problem-statement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>V-Sekai aims to provide a high-performance platform for virtual worlds and avatar-based social games. The current implementation relies on GDScript or C++ native modules, which may not offer the desired performance, user agency, complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>V-Sekai utilizes WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance performance, offering an alternative to GDScript.</p>
<section id="ownership" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ownership">Ownership</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core modules: Owned by V-Sekai</li>
<li>Custom modules: Owned by users</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="security" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="security">Security</h3>
<p>User-uploaded Wasm modules undergo a two-step process for safety and unauthorized access prevention:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Ensure module structure and integrity adhere to security standards.</li>
<li><strong>Sandboxing</strong>: Confine modules in a secure environment, restricting system resource access and mitigating potential harm.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="functionality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="functionality">Functionality</h3>
<p>Wasm modules facilitate advanced functions in virtual worlds and avatar-based social games, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient character animations</li>
<li>Interactive environments</li>
<li>Real-time multiplayer networking</li>
<li>Immersive gameplay experiences</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The proposed solution uses WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance performance and functionality in V-Sekai through User-Generated Content (UGC) Wasm modules. These modules are attached to an existing base node as a script, enabling them to provide property data and behavior for nodes in the virtual world or game.</p>
<p>Here’s a concise explanation of the implementation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>User uploads a Wasm module</strong>: Custom Wasm modules with desired functionality are uploaded to V-Sekai.</li>
<li><strong>Attach Wasm module to a node</strong>: The Wasm module is attached to a node as a script, providing advanced functionality for the node.</li>
<li><strong>Implement behavior within the Variant dictionary</strong>: Node behavior is defined within script variable, enabling Wasm modules to provide both property data and behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize Godot’s set_script property</strong>: Using Godot’s <code>set_script</code> property, Wasm modules are attached to nodes and objects, simplifying dependency handling.</li>
<li><strong>Properties after the set script</strong>: Adding properties directly onto the node after the script = property is set</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach ensures graceful handling of missing resources while offering advanced functionality through user-uploaded Wasm modules.</p>
</section>
<section id="positive-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance for complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution</li>
<li>Greater user control over scripts and customization</li>
<li>Enhanced functionality for virtual worlds and avatar-based social games</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Potential security risks with user-uploaded Wasm modules</li>
<li>Increased complexity in implementation and maintenance</li>
<li>Ensuring a wasm module has no defects is difficult with or without source code.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Optimizing GDScript</strong>: Improving the performance of GDScript was considered, but it would not provide the same level of performance boost as WebAssembly.</li>
<li><strong>Using a different scripting language</strong>: Alternative scripting languages like Lua or Python were considered, but they also do not offer the desired performance improvements compared to WebAssembly.</li>
<li><strong>Native code integration</strong>: Integrating native code (C++, Rust, etc.) directly into V-Sekai was considered, but it would increase complexity and maintenance efforts. Additionally, it would not provide the same level of security and sandboxing as WebAssembly.</li>
</ol>

<p>No, the enhancement aims to provide a significant performance boost and advanced functionality that cannot be achieved with a few lines of script.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-a-reason-why-this-should-be-core-and-done-by-us">Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?</h2>
<p>Yes, integrating Wasm into V-Sekai’s core ensures optimal performance and seamless integration with existing systems.</p>

<li><p><strong>Using Git Submodules</strong>: Use <code>git submodule</code> to include the PMX module in the V-Sekai project. While this approach allows for easier updates and maintenance, it can be more complex to set up and manage compared to <code>git subrepo</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating a separate plugin</strong>: Develop the PMX module as a standalone plugin that users can install and enable in their projects.

<h1>Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement</h1>
<section id="metadata" class="level3">

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?</p>
</section>
<section id="describe-the-proposed-option-and-how-it-helps-to-overcome-the-problem-or-limitation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-the-proposed-option-and-how-it-helps-to-overcome-the-problem-or-limitation">Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation</h3>
<p>The proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.</p>
</section>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-how-your-proposal-will-work-with-code-pseudo-code-mock-ups-or-diagrams">Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Head: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.</li>
<li>Left Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.</li>
<li>Right Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.</li>
<li>Hips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.</li>
<li>Left Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.</li>
<li>Right Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Chest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.</li>
<li>Left Elbow: Attach a tracker to the left elbow to monitor its angle, speed, and position. This helps improve the accuracy of tracking arm movements during activities like soccer and dancing.</li>
<li>Right Elbow: In the same way, place a tracker on the right elbow to keep track of its angle, speed, and position. This also enhances the precision of tracking arm movements in sports such as soccer and dance performances.</li>
</ol>
<p>By gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.</p>
</section>
<section id="positive-consequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Effective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.</li>
<li>The solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.</li>
<li>Flexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.</li>
<li>Potential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h3>
<p>Camera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.</p>
<p>Camera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.</p>

<p>We have successfully tested a MacOS editor on the iPhone in February 2023. Now, we want to build a similar editor for the iPad so that people can upload game worlds and avatars from a tablet. However, due to iOS limitations, it’s impossible to run multiple instances of the app or restart the app on non-jailbroken devices. Therefore, we need to adapt the existing codebase to work within these constraints.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>V-Sekai is facing a problem with efficiently managing and synchronizing data across multiple devices and platforms.</p>
<p>The goal is to find a more reliable and efficient solution for data synchronization that can handle large amounts of data, minimize latency, and ensure data consistency across all devices and platforms.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>We propose a new approach that involves directly inserting data into the MVSQLite cluster database and implementing a robust syncing mechanism to ensure data consistency across all devices and platforms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Modify the editor export process to stream MVSQLite to the Godot Engine server.</li>
<li>Schedule externally consistent syncing of MVSQLite with the Godot Engine server (1 frame).</li>
<li>Schedule periodic syncing of MVSQLite to a backup (e.g., every 30 minutes).</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<pre class="gdscript"><code># Step 1: Insert MVSQLite data directly into the MVSQLite database.
func insert_data_to_database():
    var mvsqlite_data = get_mvsqlite_data()
    var db = MVSQLite.new()
    db.open("user://your_database_name.db")
    for data in mvsqlite_data:
        db.execute("INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)", [data.column1, data.column2])
    db.close()

# Step 2: Schedule externally consistent syncing of MVSQLite with the SQLite database (1 frame).
func _process(delta):
    if should_sync():
        insert_data_to_database()

# Step 3: Schedule periodic syncing of MVSQLite to a backup (e.g., every 30 minutes).
var backup_timer = Timer.new()
func _ready():
    backup_timer.set_wait_time(1800) # 30 minutes in seconds
    backup_timer.connect("timeout", self, "_on_backup_timer_timeout")
    add_child(backup_timer)
    backup_timer.start()

func _on_backup_timer_timeout():
    insert_data_to_database()

# Helper functions
func get_mvsqlite_data():
    # Placeholder for obtaining MVSQLite data from the project
    pass

func should_sync():
    # Placeholder for determining when to sync MVSQLite data with the SQLite database

<section id="positive-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved data management and performance.</li>
<li>Enhanced security through server validation and sanitization.</li>
<li>Reduced load on the client-side.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Increased complexity in the system architecture.</li>
<li>Potential challenges in implementing the new architecture.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="option-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option Graveyard</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Client-side caching</strong>: Storing data on the client-side to reduce server load. However, this approach can lead to security vulnerabilities and inconsistent data across clients.</li>
<li><strong>Static file export</strong>: Exporting data as static files instead of using MVSQLite. This option was rejected due to limited flexibility and scalability.</li>
</ol>
<p>These options were considered but ultimately rejected in favor of the proposed solution, which aims to balance performance, security, and maintainability.</p>

<section id="if-this-enhancement-will-be-used-infrequently-can-it-be-worked-around-with-a-few-lines-of-script" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-this-enhancement-will-be-used-infrequently-can-it-be-worked-around-with-a-few-lines-of-script">If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?</h2>
<p>The proposed enhancement is designed to address core limitations in V-Sekai’s architecture and cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-there-a-reason-why-this-should-be-core-and-done-by-us" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-a-reason-why-this-should-be-core-and-done-by-us">Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?</h2>
<p>Implementing this solution at the core level ensures that all users benefit from improved data management, performance, and security. Additionally, addressing these limitations at the core level allows for better integration with other components of the system.</p>
