## Virtual worlds learning plan template

Before launching any of these activities, it's essential to establish clear deadlines, outlines, and boundaries. Consider the following questions:

- What are we learning?
- Why?
- What is the objective?
- What prior knowledge is required?
- Who exactly is the intended audience?

### Hands-on Learning

For hands-on learning, identify a good use case that is relevant to virtual worlds and doesn't take too long to complete.

#### Example: [Activity Name]

- **What are we learning?** [Learning topic]
- **Why?** [Reason for learning this topic]
- **What is the objective?** [Objective of the activity]
- **What prior knowledge is required?** [Required prior knowledge]
- **Who exactly is the intended audience?** [Intended audience]

### Group Activity Idea

If the community likes group activities, consider a themed challenge or collaboration. Participants can work together or compete in teams to create something related to the theme.

#### Example: [Group Activity Name]

- **What are we learning?** [Learning topic]
- **Why?** [Reason for learning this topic]
- **What is the objective?** [Objective of the activity]
- **What prior knowledge is required?** [Required prior knowledge]
- **Who exactly is the intended audience?** [Intended audience]

### Creative Exploration Idea

Allow participants to engage with the learning material as much or as little as they want without requiring or assuming anything.

#### Example: [Creative Exploration Activity Name]

- **What are we learning?** [Learning topic]
- **Why?** [Reason for learning this topic]
- **What is the objective?** [Objective of the activity]
- **What prior knowledge is required?** [Required prior knowledge]
- **Who exactly is the intended audience?** [Intended audience]

### Real-world Application Challenge

Encourage participants to apply their learning to a real-world scenario or problem. Participants can choose their own approach, tools, or frameworks to complete the challenge.

#### Example: [Real-world Application Challenge Name]

- **What are we learning?** [Learning topic]
- **Why?** [Reason for learning this topic]
- **What is the objective?** [Objective of the activity]
- **What prior knowledge is required?** [Required prior knowledge]
- **Who exactly is the intended audience?** [Intended audience]

By addressing these questions and organizing the activities, you'll create a more effective and enjoyable learning experience for participants in virtual worlds.
