### Proposal Title

Benchmark animation playback

### Context and Problem Statement

How slow is animation playback in a simulated player situation.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Need to see where we're at.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

100, 500, 1'000, 50'000 avatars animating with 30fps and animation compression on vs off.

Randomize clips: idle, run, jump, walk (left, right, back, front) 

Put them into a 2d blend space and feed a random velocity.

Start the animations at different random offsets.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Core code.

### Positive Consequences

* Can investigate compressed animation player as a compute shader. The current architecture of the skinning and blend shapes animations is like vertex animations fed by buffers, but the keyframe playback is also problematic

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I care about this more than other core contributors.
