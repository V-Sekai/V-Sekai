### Context and Problem Statement

We need a demo of our work.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Make a game out of having two groups attack each other.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. mass A versus mass B
2. path find to each other
3. use avoidance
4. attack

## Additional features for the test

1. can use wasm scripting
2. in-game tablet drag to place objects

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is an integration test.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

It helps us focus.
