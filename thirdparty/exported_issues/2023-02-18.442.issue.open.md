### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai is cumbersome to use in small physical spaces.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Propose to use redirected walking.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

When the player moves, the space is warped to reduce the distance travelled.

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

Allow open worlds to be more usable.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature.
