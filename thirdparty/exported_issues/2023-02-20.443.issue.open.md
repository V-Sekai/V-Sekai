# [\#443 Issue](https://github.com/V-Sekai/manuals/issues/443) `open`: Create an outfit switch system so that changing clothing context doesn't require an avatar reload
**Labels**: `enhancement`

### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,lyuma,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

Lyuma wants to hop into a swimming pool and switch to a swimsuit or dance and turn off the garment in the way.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Allow the player to toggle off the body with alpha layers and turn on the garment.

Able to have one avatar with multiple outfits but efficiently on the device.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Use 3 bitmasks which are 8 bit. Avoid RGBAH because of complexity. 

We have 3 rgb color channels, so we can do up to 24*3 with 8bit. 

This means we can have 72 arbitrary alpha layers per material.

Be able to animate the switch, not simply toggle in a single frame.

Apply the alpha layers by using the NAN floating point trick on the mesh vertices to discard them.

For ease of use, we will create an animation that has a 0 to 1 in discrete mode that changes the panel combinations.

### Positive Consequences

Without a reload we can switch clothing without clipping the skin.

Efficient.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

- Option: scale individual meshes to 0 and toggle them on and off using animations.
- Rejection Reason: bad performance

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature. So is performance.

Silent's Cel Shading Shader has 16 inventory slots and almost does this.

The https://cafemohka.booth.pm/items/4265391 model is already setup for the uv trick. Will try the SCSS inventory.

> This is a feature in SCSS, so you should be using SCSS. Either Lightramp or Crosstone modes are fine, and it works with or without outlines and with or without transparency.

> a. If you see issues when importing to Blender, like the bones are pointing in strange directions, try following [the instructions here](https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/SCSS/-/wikis/Other/FBX-and-Blender) for a better import. If your model was exported from Blender, these steps aren't generally necessary.
>
> Decide on the UV stride - how far apart each item is. If the model doesn't use tiling patterns on the X axis, and the UVs don't come up right up against the edge, you can use a stride of 1.
> 
> For each item, move it over by the stride. For example, if you have a stride of 1, then select the affected item's UVs and move them over. In Blender, the easiest way to do this is to select the UVs and press G (grab), X (x-axis), and then hold Ctrl (move in fixed increments) while dragging it over. The bottom corner will show how many units you've moved it by, so many sure that's exactly 1.00 for the first item, 2.00 for the second item, and so on.

> Combine the meshes together! You should aim for a layout like this:
> 
> 1. Face
> 2. Body
> 3. Clothes (combined)
> 
> Export the finished model to Unity. Now the toggles will work! However, you'll need to set up the animations for them again if they were using regular skinned mesh toggles before.

1. Move the meshes in this pattern for organization.
  2. base mesh, default garment 0, garment 1, garment 2, garment 3, base mesh (skin only)
3. Move the uvs by adding the global x coordinate value to the mesh x-axis uv
4. Duplicate the textures as many number of inventory items. to the right
5. Unpack all resources (like images).
6. Tile UDIMM tile n times for n items. Name the images like `Chroma.Tx.Shirt.<UDIM>.png`.

7. Keep face like blend shapes separate
8. Merge clothing.
9. Merge body unless it's something like the breast area that moves the entire body via blend shapes
10. Overlap all the meshes.

Sort by uv distance = x + uv 
and y for each texture
to conserve UDIM texture space

Use the names to layout a hierachy `Mire.Ms.Garments` in the grid layout.

Blender only allows 0 to 10 uv coordinates.. Might be a UDIM trick.

I would recommend against using Blender's UDIM tile system since each of these tiles use the same texture.

As for the distance between tiles, it is assigned in `_InventoryStride`, so it is posible to permit spacing them further than 1 if tiling is needed.

In a conventional blender UV map, it is sufficient to move polygons by integer offsets of any amount. The 10 limit is only when using Blender's  UDIM tile system.

That said, if you want to use more, you can always change the shader to use `in_texcoord.y` instead of `in_texcoord.x` and then you can have unlimited vertical tiles in Blender.
