## Background

MeshGPT uses a transformer model trained on geometric vocabulary to generate triangle meshes, resulting in clean, coherent, and compact meshes.

## Problem

The challenge is adapting GPT-like generative models for the 3D domain. Automated triangle mesh generation needs a robust solution.

## Strategy

Our strategy revolves around the creation of a model called MeshRWKV. This model will be specifically trained for Elixir using RWKV4. The process involves two main steps:

1. **Learning a Vocabulary for Triangle Meshes:** The first step is to learn a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes. This vocabulary will serve as the foundation for our mesh generation.

2. **Autoregressive Mesh Generation:** Once we have our vocabulary, we use it for autoregressive generation of a mesh. This process is carried out by an encoder-decoder network. This network features vector quantization at its bottleneck, which allows us to maintain the compactness and coherence of the generated meshes.

After the training phase, our model will be capable of directly sampling meshes as sequences from this vocabulary. This means that given a sequence of words from our vocabulary, the model can generate a corresponding mesh.

## Benefits

Our approach produces compact meshes with sharp geometric details. It can suggest multiple shape completions for incomplete shapes.

## Drawbacks

Training the model may require significant computational resources. Learning a vocabulary for triangle meshes could be complex.

## Alternatives

Other methods like neural field-based approaches exist but often miss geometric details or produce over-triangulated meshes.

## Special Use Case

Generating complex 3D shapes for niche applications might need additional model training or fine-tuning.

## Core & Implemented by Us?

Yes, this proposal is core to our work at V-Sekai and will be implemented by us.
