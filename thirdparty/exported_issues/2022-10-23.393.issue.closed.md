### Context and Problem Statement

We need to implement implement better compression for mobile gpus.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Implement ASTC for Godot Engine.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Take Reduz's astc patch and merge my initial build of astc cli tool.
2. Implement an astc image class
 
### Positive Consequences

Will be able to get better quality for Godot Engine the focus 3 and the quest.

### Negative Consequences

ASTC can sometimes take a long time to compress.

### Option graveyard

Do nothing.

Rejected because it means mobile devices have bad results.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

We cannot resolve this with merely a few lines of code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Can be done by others, but fire developed the idea with reduz.
