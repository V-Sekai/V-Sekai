What tools and techniques can we use?\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse AMDuProf\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nAMDuProf shows the slower functions and there's also a callgraph and flamegraph feature.\n\nA callgraph is similar to a stacktrace.\n\nA flamegraph is a way of visualizing performance.\n\nThe workflow is for each item start from the top and go down.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Works for both Intel and AMD\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Less usable than superluminal\n- Slower than superluminal\n\n[this section can be repeated for each option, if more than one option is open for consideration]\n\n## Option graveyard: same as above\n\n* Option: superluminal\n* Rejection reason: \n    * Not free\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot appliable.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nNot in code. This is documenting a technique.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://superluminal.eu/\n- https://developer.amd.com/amd-uprof"},"creationDate":"2021-05-29T15:10:00.000Z","lastEditDate":"2021-05-29T15:10:00.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"K.
