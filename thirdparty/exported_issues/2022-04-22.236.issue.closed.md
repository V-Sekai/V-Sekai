### List the deciders of the issue.

V-Sekai,fire

### Describe the tags of the issue.

V-Sekai,knative,

### Context and Problem Statement

I want a way to robustly calculate a function that is scalable.

The example is to count the number of meshes and primitives nodes in a scene.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Post a element message and an output file is attached.

Using knative, we're able to divide work into functions and to calculate the required task.

1. Upload a vrm with curl.

```bash
curl -X POST \
    'http://localhost:8080/count_node_mesh_primitives' \
    -H 'authorization: EXAMPLEEXAMPLEXAMPLE' \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-binary '@/home/vsekai/avatar.glb'
```

3. Pass to knative.
4. Execute a way to count the vrm's mesh node and primitive count.

6. Return text. Return attachments.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Install kind.

Install rancher desktop using docker.

Install `kn` and `kn-quickstart`.

Use `kn quickstart kind` to run in docker.

Use knative to create a function.

Use Blender to calculate the math.

Use the inmemory or rabbitmq brokers.

### Positive Consequences

More robustness and separation of concerns.

### Negative Consequences

Kubernetes is complicated.

### Option graveyard

- openfaas
- membrane framework
- rancherdesktop

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

The function could be a bash script but the plumbing is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I know a way!
