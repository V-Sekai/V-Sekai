V-Sekai,

Want a workflow to profile Godot Groups.

Use perf and hotspot.

sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`

### Positive Consequences

Can better find hotspots.

### Negative Consequences

Currently Linux only.

### Option graveyard

- Superluminal is Windows only.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not Godot Engine code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need to be aware of performance.
