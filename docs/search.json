    "text": "Ported RenIK to GDScript, providing a reference implementation and allowing for separation of RenIKPlacement from RenIK as two distinct nodes. This change enables reuse of the foot placement implementation on any other IK system or swapping out the foot placement system for another animation system and then running the IK algorithm independently. The port was challenging due to differences in the Basis APIs between C++ and GDScript.

    "text": "In May 2023, significant progress was made in the Godot community and V-Sekai project. Key developments include the implementation of WebAssembly modules for Godot Engine 4, improvements to the V-Sekai Godot Engine fork, and advancements in Unidot’s FBX humanoid support. Additionally, there were updates to the manual site, suggestions for Blender VRM drag-and-drop support, and bug fixes related to LODs.\n\nhttps://github.com/ashtonmeuser/godot-wasm/tree/godot-4 Implements wasm modules for Godot Engine 4.\nFire has chatgpt4 api access.\nMerged godot-wasm into V-Sekai Godot Engine fork for experimenting with user generated scripting and optimization of computation.\nvsk_speech branch of V-Sekai Godot Engine passes cicd again!!\nRevised and optimized the manual site.\nSuggested that .VRM drag and drop support is added to Blender. https://github.com/mika-f/blender-drag-and-drop/issues/34#issuecomment-1539429579\nUse a better representation of feminine and masculine avatars\nFixing bugs with lods\n\n\n\nLyuma has been working on implementing imported humanoid FBX support in Unidot, including bone guessing. The current implementation supports FBX source models and performs bone name guessing when humanDescription is empty. However, it does not yet support humanoid .anim clips, and there are known issues applying Animator components to already-imported models.\nAfter fixing a typo in Fix Silhouette, Lyuma reported that FBX humanoid animation import in Unidot seems much closer. They also implemented support for “Copy from other Avatar” to handle conversion of Maya FBX files with the first frame posed like the animation. This allows using the T-pose of another model as the rest pose.\nLyuma shared their progress on Twitter, showcasing the effectiveness of Unidot-Importer by VSekaiOfficial and Godot 4.0’s new humanoid retargeter system. The Godot Engine community also discovered the team’s GLTF work, as seen in a tweet by Bramwell.\nGamefromscratch covered Godot -&gt; Unity migration in a YouTube video, highlighting the use of barcoderdev’s version of FBX2glTF with Unidot, which might solve the pivot issue encountered earlier."

    "text": "In June 2023, various developments and discussions took place in the Godot community, particularly within the V-Sekai project. Key highlights include updates to the godot-vrm repository, security improvements in the v-sekai-game repository, and progress on animation retargeting and PMX character structure. Additionally, a fix was implemented for Skeleton3D’s rest_dirty reset issue.\n\nFork created: aaronfranke/godot-vrm (01/06/2023)\nNew commits in V-Sekai/godot-vrm repository, including updates to load_at_runtime_scene for 4.x and adding files_dropped functionality (02/06/2023)\nPR 130 closed, bumping github/codeql-action from 2.3.5 to 2.3.6 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nPR 129 closed, bumping actions/setup-dotnet from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nStepSecurity bot opened PR 131 to apply security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to avoid the empty avatar crash (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error (02/06/2023)\nNew tag created in V-Sekai/godot: groups-4.x.2023-06-03T034215Z (02/06/2023)\nPR 131 closed, applying security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to make joining a server less crashy (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to remove debug points (02/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: codeql (02/06/2023)\nPR 132 opened, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew comment on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing how to make a VRM model pose using GDScript (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error part 3, avoiding runtime errors, and removing gut (02/06/2023 - 03/06/2023)\nPR 132 closed, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nPR 133 opened, hardening GitHub Actions in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nNew comments on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing animation retargeting and PMX character structure (03/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including removing hardcoded gravity and gravity direction, inverting state machine condition, and setting up work in progress state chart (03/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: state-chart (03/06/2023)\nSkeleton3D now correctly resets rest_dirty only after all bone transforms have been updated (PR 78025 by lyuma). This also resolves the SkeletonGizmo display issue when there is more than one bone root.\n\n\n\nThe team has introduced a feature that allows for easy setup with just a single click. Additionally, they’re now utilizing an advanced system known as the Many Bones’ solver.\n\n\n\nThere were some concerns about how much time the GPU was spending on processing the shader - think of the shader like a set of instructions telling the GPU how to draw each pixel. The frame times, or the speed at which frames are processed, seemed to be slower than expected. However, it was clarified that these tests were being run in a mode designed for finding errors (debug mode), not for optimal performance.\n\n\n\nThe team discussed how their system’s performance stacks up against other virtual reality social platforms. They used different types of hardware for these comparisons, similar to comparing the performance of different cars using various types of roads and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe team also talked about how to best optimize their system for different devices. This is akin to tuning a car’s engine differently depending on whether it’s going to be driven in the city or on a racetrack.\n\n\n\nThere were discussions about the challenges of rendering avatars, especially when there are multiple avatars on the screen at once. It’s like trying to paint multiple portraits at the same time - the more you have, the harder it gets. The team discussed the need for guidelines to help avatar creators optimize their designs for less powerful hardware.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, the team plans to conduct more tests, particularly focusing on how well their system handles complex 3D models on Android devices. They also aim to create a benchmark scenario where they expect good performance across most platforms, much like setting a standard track to test different cars’ performances."

Worked on the design of EWBIK bone weights and bone priority. Worked on the different bone rolls vs silhouette problem in regular 3d formats versus VRM which has a indentity bone roll. (Use the original bone and then parent the change to be in ewbik bone roll.) Made the EWBIK solve less jello. Also discussion using kusudama constraints in Godot Engine core."

    "text": "In software development and maintenance, automation of routine tasks is crucial for efficiency. One such task is launching a database server at system startup. For macOS users, this can be achieved using launchd, an open-source service management framework. In this context, we are specifically interested in automating the launch of the mvsqlite RDBMS server.\n\n\n\nThe task at hand is to create a launchd service for macOS that will automatically run the following command at system startup:\n/usr/local/bin/mvstore --data-plane 127.0.0.1:7000 --admin-api 127.0.0.1:7001 --metadata-prefix mvstore-test --raw-data-prefix m --auto-create-namespace --cluster /usr/local/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster\nAdditionally, we need to be able to retrieve logs from this service and check its status.\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we can create a .plist file in the ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory. This file will define our launchd service and specify the command it should run. We can also add keys to redirect the standard output and error to log files. Finally, we can use the launchctl list command to check the status of our service.\nHere are the detailed steps:\n\n\n\nOpen Terminal and navigate to the LaunchAgents directory:\n\ncd ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nCreate a new .plist file called com.user.mvstore.plist:\n\ntouch com.user.mvstore.plist\n\nOpen the file with a text editor (e.g., nano):\n\nnano com.user.mvstore.plist\n\nPaste the following content into the file:\n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;plist version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;dict&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;com.user.mvstore&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;array&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/mvstore&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--data-plane&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;127.0.0.1:7000&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--admin-api&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;127.0.0.1:7001&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--metadata-prefix&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;mvstore-test&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--raw-data-prefix&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;m&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--auto-create-namespace&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;--cluster&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;/array&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;true/&gt;\n    &lt;key&gt;EnvironmentVariables&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;dict&gt;\n        &lt;key&gt;RUST_LOG&lt;/key&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;info&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;key&gt;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/key&gt;\n        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/string&gt;\n    &lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;\n\nSave and close the file.\nLoad the new service:\n\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.mvstore.plist\n\n\n\nTo retrieve logs from the launchd service, add the StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath keys to the .plist file. These keys will redirect the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to specified log files.\n\n\n\nTo check the launchd status for mvsqlite, use the launchctl list command:\nlaunchctl list | grep mvstore\n\n\n\n\nAutomating tasks with launchd can save time and reduce the risk of errors.

    "text": "Accepted: Adding IREE to Godot Engine for Image Superresolution\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: accepted \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai, IREE, Godot Engine, Image Superresolution, Vulkan Backend,chatgpt 4,Google,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nV-Sekai currently faces a limitation in the quality of upscaled images, particularly when the image needs to be magnified by a factor of 4x or more.\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nIntegrate the Intermediate Representation Execution Environment (IREE) into the Godot Engine 4.0 as a C++ GDExtension. Utilize the Vulkan backend to run an image superresolution demo that generates 4x larger images. IREE is an MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR, allowing for better performance and scaling.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nCompile IREE as a C++ GDExtension for Godot Engine 4.0.\nUse the Vulkan backend to run the image superresolution demo.\nLoad and process ML models for image superresolution using IREE.\nIntegrate the resulting functionality into V-Sekai’s existing image processing pipeline.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nAllow image superresolution in V-Sekai.\nEnhanced performance due to IREE’s efficient MLIR-based compiler and runtime.\nScalable solution that adapts to various hardware and software constraints. Not only NVIDIA, but ARM, Intel, AMD and Apple gpus.\nAllow using other machine learning models from PyTorch and Tensorflow\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nAdditional development time required for integration and optimization.\nPotential trade-offs in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse a custom script to work around the image superresolution issue.\n\nThis might not provide a scalable or high-performance solution.\n\nImplement a different image superresolution algorithm.\n\nThis could lead to suboptimal results compared to IREE’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nA custom script could serve as a workaround for infrequent use of image superresolution, but it may have drawbacks in terms of efficiency, output quality, and maintenance efforts. If the feature aligns with V-Sekai’s goals and significantly improves user experience, integrating the IREE-based solution into the core might be more effective.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIn summary, integrating the IREE-based image superresolution feature into V-Sekai’s core offers several benefits, including an enhanced user experience, performance optimization, alignment with open source values, and easier maintenance and support. These advantages contribute to a better, more immersive VR experience while staying true to V-Sekai’s project goals.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nIREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment): https://github.com/openxla/iree\nGodot Engine: https://godotengine.org\nVulkan Backend: https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/\nIREE.gd: https://github.com/RechieKho/IREE.gd"

To compile dependencies:\nmix do compile, phx.digest\nIf one of them gives an error due to nmake or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a x64 Native Tools command prompt from visual studio and run mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir\nFinally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:\nmix ecto.create\nmix ecto.migrate\niex.bat --werl -S mix phx.server\nThis will start uro at http://localhost:4000/\nCreate a user in the website register user page.\nGo to the console and set the user to be admin.\niex.bat --werl -S mix phx.server\n# TODO\n# Call Uro.Accounts.update_user_as_admin\nGitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir …\nThe docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.\nThen, go to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).\nNow, edit the flux config at https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.\nCheck that uro-deployment was updated.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe’re able to update uro!\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nNo response\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt’s arguably a few lines of script, but it’s our script!\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe maintain the website.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nUro\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro/issues/52\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, Bioblaze Payne, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, GPT-4\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is a project that aims to provide an immersive virtual world experience for users. As the project grows in complexity, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the system is thoroughly tested and can handle various scenarios. One of the challenges faced by the V-Sekai team is the lack of diverse and realistic data for testing purposes. This limitation hinders the ability to identify potential issues and optimize the system’s performance.\n\n\n\nTo address the limitations in testing the V-Sekai system due to the lack of diverse and realistic data, this proposal suggests generating random text data for testing purposes.\n\n\nWe will use a tool like Chance.js library to generate random text data for testing purposes and use the database.\n\n\nFor generating random sentences, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.sentence();\nReference: Chance.js Sentence\n\n\n\nFor generating random user names, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.name();\nReference: Chance.js Name\n\n\n\nWe will perform the following SQL operations on the user and chat tables:\n\nSELECT All Data in Table\nSELECT LIKE Data based on %NA%\nSELECT Specific Row Data\nINSERT\nUPDATE\nDELETE\n\n\n\nTable user\nid | username | password | updated_on | created_on |\nTable chat\nid | user_id | name | text | updated_on | deleted_on | created_on |\n\n\n\n\nWe will create a SQL function to check if the username/password match and return ‘OK’. We will also check if the query returned is ‘OK’ and add false information randomly in the nodes to signify a user doing invalid calls for production testing.\nThe implementation will generate 90 days of data, generating 100,000 text data entries for testing purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved testing capabilities with diverse and realistic data\nEnhanced system reliability due to thorough testing\nIdentification of potential issues before they impact users\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional development time required to implement the solution\nPotential increase in storage requirements for generated data\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing static test data: This option was considered for simplicity, but it would not provide the diverse and realistic data needed for thorough testing.\nManual data generation: This option involved manually creating test data, but it was deemed time-consuming and inefficient compared to using a library like Chance.js.\nThird-party data generation services: While there are external services that can generate random text data, using them would introduce dependencies and potential costs. Implementing our a solution similar to Chance.js allows for better control over the process.\nCrowdsourcing test data: This option involved gathering test data from users or volunteers. However, it raised concerns about data privacy, consistency, and quality.\n\n\n\n\nNo, this enhancement is essential for thorough testing and cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nYes, addressing the V-Sekai limitation is crucial for ensuring the system’s reliability and performance. Implementing this solution internally allows for better control over the testing process and data generation.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "Proposed: Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: superseded by 20230602-limited-tracker-placement.md \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Shoulder: A tracker on the left shoulder to track upper arm rotation, allowing for more precise tracking of arm movements during soccer and dancing.\nRight Shoulder: A tracker on the right shoulder to track upper arm rotation, complementing the left shoulder tracker for better arm movement tracking.\nLeft Knee: A tracker on the left knee to track left leg movement, enhancing the realism of leg movements and providing more accurate feedback for actions like kicking in soccer or complex footwork in dancing.\nRight Knee: A tracker on the right knee to track right leg movement, mirroring the benefits of the left knee tracker for a balanced leg movement representation.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai currently has limitations when it comes to creating avatars with specific features and customizations. This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.\n\n\n\nHere is a list of raw processes to be broken down.\n\n\n\nSource: The source will provide the initial avatar model and any additional assets required. The input mime type for the source could be application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json if the avatar is in GLTF format, or image/png or image/svg+xml if the avatar is provided as a 2D image.\nFilter: The filter will handle all the customization steps mentioned above. It will take the input from the source and apply the necessary modifications to create the desired avatar. The input mime type for the filter would be the same as the output mime type of the source, depending on whether the avatar is in GLTF format or represented as an image.\nSink: The sink will receive the customized avatar from the filter and store it as the final output. For this project, the sink should support both PNG and SVG images for 2D avatars, and GLTF for 3D avatars. Therefore, the output mime types for the sink would be image/png or image/svg+xml for 2D avatars, and application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json for 3D avatars.\n\nNote: To avoid lossy formats, we are using PNG or SVG for 2D images and GLTF for 3D formats. PNG and SVG are lossless image formats, while GLTF is a lossless 3D format that preserves the fidelity of the avatar model.\n\n\n\nHere are the converted inputs and outputs in the xstate format for each step:\n\nImporting the avatar into Godot Engine and “Project Mirage”:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nRefining the imported avatar:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nConverting spring bone to physical simulation bones and colliders:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: assetpackage file\n\nAddressing painting errors:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nChoosing a material:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nResolving issues with materials and bones:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nCorrecting colors and addressing pleated folds:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nCreating complex geometric structures:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nUtilizing Vroid Hub’s hair painter and mesh generator:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm enhanced data\n\n\nAdding facial expressions for motion capture:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .gltf motion capture data\n\n\nSetting up motion capture:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: vrm animations data stored as .gltf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers will be able to create highly customizable avatars with specific features.\nThe avatar creation process will be enhanced with a variety of tools and techniques.\nDetailed customization of colors, clothing, accessories, and facial expressions will be possible.\nMotion capture capabilities can be integrated for more realistic animations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation process is complex and may require advanced technical skills from users.\nSome steps, like creating a 3D model of the back of the avatar, may not always be successful.\nPainting errors and other imperfections may remain in the final avatar.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcessive complexity or technical requirements: We want the avatar creation process to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, so any options that require advanced technical skills or have excessively complex customization controls will not be included.\n\n\n\n\nNo, the proposed enhancement involves a multi-step process that cannot be easily replicated with just a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nThe proposed enhancement addresses the limitations in V-Sekai’s avatar creation process, providing users with a comprehensive solution for creating highly customizable avatars.

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai aims to provide a high-performance platform for virtual worlds and avatar-based social games. The current implementation relies on GDScript or C++ native modules, which may not offer the desired performance, user agency, complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai utilizes WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance performance, offering an alternative to GDScript.\n\n\n\nCore modules: Owned by V-Sekai\nCustom modules: Owned by users\n\n\n\n\nUser-uploaded Wasm modules undergo a two-step process for safety and unauthorized access prevention:\n\nValidation: Ensure module structure and integrity adhere to security standards.\nSandboxing: Confine modules in a secure environment, restricting system resource access and mitigating potential harm.\n\n\n\n\nWasm modules facilitate advanced functions in virtual worlds and avatar-based social games, such as:\n\nEfficient character animations\nInteractive environments\nReal-time multiplayer networking\nImmersive gameplay experiences\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed solution uses WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance performance and functionality in V-Sekai through User-Generated Content (UGC) Wasm modules. These modules are attached to an existing base node as a script, enabling them to provide property data and behavior for nodes in the virtual world or game.\nHere’s a concise explanation of the implementation:\n\nUser uploads a Wasm module: Custom Wasm modules with desired functionality are uploaded to V-Sekai.\nAttach Wasm module to a node: The Wasm module is attached to a node as a script, providing advanced functionality for the node.\nImplement behavior within the Variant dictionary: Node behavior is defined within script variable, enabling Wasm modules to provide both property data and behavior.\nUtilize Godot’s set_script property: Using Godot’s set_script property, Wasm modules are attached to nodes and objects, simplifying dependency handling.\nProperties after the set script: Adding properties directly onto the node after the script = property is set\n\nThis approach ensures graceful handling of missing resources while offering advanced functionality through user-uploaded Wasm modules.\n\n\n\n\nImproved performance for complex calculations, graphics rendering, and algorithm execution\nGreater user control over scripts and customization\nEnhanced functionality for virtual worlds and avatar-based social games\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential security risks with user-uploaded Wasm modules\nIncreased complexity in implementation and maintenance\nEnsuring a wasm module has no defects is difficult with or without source code.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing GDScript: Improving the performance of GDScript was considered, but it would not provide the same level of performance boost as WebAssembly.\nUsing a different scripting language: Alternative scripting languages like Lua or Python were considered, but they also do not offer the desired performance improvements compared to WebAssembly.\nNative code integration: Integrating native code (C++, Rust, etc.) directly into V-Sekai was considered, but it would increase complexity and maintenance efforts. Additionally, it would not provide the same level of security and sandboxing as WebAssembly.\n\n\n\n\nNo, the enhancement aims to provide a significant performance boost and advanced functionality that cannot be achieved with a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nYes, integrating Wasm into V-Sekai’s core ensures optimal performance and seamless integration with existing systems.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nashtonmeuser/godot-wasm/issues/43\nThis article was assisted by AI.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a glossary of definitions to help people understand the terms used in the Wasm in V-Sekai proposal:\n\nWebAssembly (Wasm): A type of code that is more portable than regular code, making games and virtual worlds work better. Originally made for the web.\nGDScript: A programming language used to make games and apps in the Godot game engine.\nC++ native modules: Pieces of code written in the C++ programming language that can be added to a game or app to make it work better.\nV-Sekai: A platform for creating virtual worlds and avatar-based social games.\nMetadata: Information about something, like who made it and what it’s for.\nValidation: Checking if something is correct and follows the rules.\nSandboxing: Putting something in a safe area where it can’t cause harm or access things it shouldn’t.\nUser-Generated Content (UGC): Things that people who use a game or app create themselves, like characters, levels, or stories.\nMissingNode: A part of the game or app that needs a script to tell it what to do.\nMissingResource: Something that a game or app needs but doesn’t have yet, like an image or sound.\nVariant: A data type in Godot that can store different kinds of information, like numbers, text, or objects. It is used to represent and manipulate data in various ways within the game engine.\nNode3D: A point in a 3D space that helps build a virtual world or game.\nGodot: A free and open-source game engine used to create games and apps.\nLua: A programming language often used in game development.\nPython: A popular programming language used for many purposes, including game development.\nRust: A programming language focused on safety and performance, often used for creating fast and reliable software."

These modules are attached to an existing base node as a script, enabling them to provide property data and behavior for nodes in the virtual world or game.\nHere’s a concise explanation of the implementation:\n\nUser uploads a Wasm module: Custom Wasm modules with desired functionality are uploaded to V-Sekai.\nAttach Wasm module to a node: The Wasm module is attached to a node as a script, providing advanced functionality for the node.\nImplement behavior within the Variant dictionary: Node behavior is defined within script variable, enabling Wasm modules to provide both property data and behavior.\nUtilize Godot’s set_script property: Using Godot’s set_script property, Wasm modules are attached to nodes and objects, simplifying dependency handling.\nProperties after the set script: Adding properties directly onto the node after the script = property is set\n\nThis approach ensures graceful handling of missing resources while offering advanced functionality through user-uploaded Wasm modules."

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, Elixir, Membrane Framework, Multiplayer Blender, JSON-RPC\n\n\n\n\nThe current solution for handling multiplayer Blender has its limitations when it comes to scalability and real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose a new approach that leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework. This will involve rewriting the code and introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner.\n\n\nIn this new approach, character posing will be handled in real-time and shared across multiple clients. This means that any changes made to a 3D model by one user will be immediately reflected on all other connected clients. This feature will enhance the collaborative experience and allow users to interact with the same 3D models simultaneously.\n\n\n\nThe state of the world, including objects, lighting, camera position, etc., will also be synchronized across all clients. This ensures that all users are experiencing the same environment, further enhancing the sense of immersion and collaboration.\n\n\n\nWe will introduce procedural generation techniques to create unique and dynamic environments. These generated worlds will be shared across all clients, ensuring that each user’s experience is not only immersive but also unique and engaging.\n\n\n\nAny drawings or annotations made using the Grease Pencil tool will be visible to all clients. This allows for collaborative sketching and planning, making it easier for teams to communicate their ideas visually.\n\n\n\nTo facilitate efficient communication with Blender, we’ll implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner. This will allow us to send commands to Blender and receive responses in a structured and standardized format. This feature will streamline the process of interacting with Blender, making it more efficient and user-friendly.\nBy implementing these features, we aim to improve the scalability and real-time performance of our multiplayer Blender solution. This will lead to a more immersive and collaborative experience for our users.\n\n\n\n\nThe main challenge is to translate the existing code into Elixir while maintaining the functionality and improving upon the limitations of the current system. This includes ensuring that the new code can handle larger volumes of users and provide real-time updates without lag or delay.\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n  A[Current Code] --&gt; B[Elixir & Membrane Framework Code]\n  C[No Authentication] --&gt; D[GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login]\n  E[No Database] --&gt; F[Khepri Database Library]\n  G[Blender Runner] --&gt; H[JSON-RPC Blender Runner]\n  I[Triangle Only] --&gt; J[Airlocks for Environment Translation]\nThis strategy leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework’s unique features, uses the Khepri database library for data management, implements GitHub login using OAuth 2.0 protocol for single sign-on, introduces a JSON-RPC Blender runner for improved communication with Blender, and focuses on the use of triangles (a polygon with 3 vertices) and “Airlocks” for environment translation.\nHere are the key steps:\n\nCodebase: Transition from the current code to Elixir & Membrane Framework Code, tracked in a version control system.\nDependencies: Declare and isolate dependencies explicitly, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.\nConfig: Store configuration (including GitHub OAuth 2.0 Login credentials) in the environment, not in the code.\nBacking Services: Replace in-memory data persistence with Khepri Database Library, attached as a backing service.\nBuild, Release, Run: Strictly separate these stages, facilitated by the Elixir & Membrane Framework Code.\nProcesses: Execute application as one or more stateless processes, storing needed state in the Khepri database.\nPort Binding: Export services via port binding, making the application self-contained.\nConcurrency: Scale out the application via the process model, allowing for handling increased load.\nDisposability: Aim for fast startup and graceful shutdown to maximize robustness.\nDev/Prod Parity: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.\nLogs: Treat logs as event streams, handled by the executing environment.\nAdmin Processes: Run any needed one-off administrative tasks in an identical environment as the regular long-running processes of the app.\nBlender Runner: Implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner to facilitate efficient communication with Blender.\nTriangle Only: This principle ensures that only triangles (polygons with 3 vertices) are used in the graphical representation. This simplifies the rendering process and reduces computational complexity.\nAirlocks: Use airlocks to translate the remote environment to the local environment. This allows for seamless interaction between different parts of the system while maintaining isolation and security.\n\n\n\n\nBy rewriting the code in Elixir, using the Membrane Framework, implementing the Khepri database library, introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner, focusing on the use of triangles, and employing the “Airlocks” principles, we can expect improved scalability and real-time performance. This will allow for more users to use the system simultaneously without experiencing delays or lags. Additionally, the fault-tolerance feature of Elixir will ensure that the system remains operational even when errors occur.\n\n\n\nRewriting the code will require time and resources. There may also be a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Elixir, the Membrane Framework, the Khepri database library, JSON-RPC, the concept of using triangles in graphics, and “Airlocks”.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach would have been to optimize the existing code instead of rewriting it. However, this would not have addressed the inherent limitations of the current system.\n\n\n\nIn cases where the number of users is low and real-time updates are not critical, the current system may still be sufficient. However, as the user base grows and the demand for real-time updates increases, the need for a more scalable and efficient system becomes apparent.\n\n\n\nYes, the rewriting of the code will indeed be done by us as we also maintain the backend services.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nElixir\nMembrane Framework\nKhepri Database Library\nJSON-RPC\n\nThis article is assisted by AI."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, Dokku, Backend, Hosting, Development\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is exploring options to improve its backend services hosting and development. The goal is to find a system that can offer scalability, ease of deployment, and efficient resource management.\n\n\n\nOne potential solution could be Dokku, a Docker-powered mini-Heroku. Dokku provides a platform that could potentially meet our needs for building, deploying and managing applications effectively.\n\n\n\nIf Dokku were chosen, the implementation would involve setting up a Dokku server, migrating existing services, and training the team on how to use Dokku for development and deployment.\n# Install Dokku\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.21.4/bootstrap.sh;\nsudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.21.4 bash bootstrap.sh\n\n\n\n\nScalability: Dokku has features that could allow us to scale our applications based on demand.\nEase of Deployment: Dokku’s git-based deployment system might simplify the process of deploying new versions of our applications.\nResource Management: Dokku’s use of Docker containers could lead to more efficient use of system resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere might be a learning curve for the team members who are not familiar with Dokku or Docker.\nMigration of existing services to a new platform could require significant time and resources.\n\n\n\n\nOther options considered include traditional VM-based hosting and other PaaS solutions like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

A line graph shows the progress of an animation over time, while a scatter plot shows the data points that were used to create an animation.\nA line graph can help you debug physics interpolation issues. If your object’s position is not moving smoothly, you can look at how it moved over time and see if there are any sudden changes or jumps in its motion that might be causing problems. This will help you determine whether you need to adjust your physics simulation or tweak some other aspect of your game design.\nSecond, you can use scatter plots to visualize how different variables interact with each other. For example, if you have an object that’s supposed to move along a straight line but instead moves in a curved path, then it might be helpful for you to see whether there are any correlations between its position and its velocity. This will help you isolate which variables are causing this behavior so that you can optimize them individually or together.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe are able to use V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nWe cannot get other features in.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nEasy chart is a gdscript addon but it is not trivial to reimplement.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nMotion posing is a core feature.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nEasy Charts"

    "text": "Proposed: Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: proposed \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nVR Tracker USB dongles need line of sight.\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement. Placed behind the body.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Elbow: Attach a tracker to the left elbow to monitor its angle, speed, and position. This helps improve the accuracy of tracking arm movements during activities like soccer and dancing.\nRight Elbow: In the same way, place a tracker on the right elbow to keep track of its angle, speed, and position. This also enhances the precision of tracking arm movements in sports such as soccer and dance performances.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

This blueprint proposes a method for creating music using computer algorithms.\n\n\n\nThe mission is to create music using computer programs.\n\n\n\nOne promising strategy is to employ .ABC files. These files have proven effective in generating outputs with AI models like GPT-3. The .ABC files carry data in the header section, such as the key signature, tempo, and time signature, which can be incorporated into the prompt.\nAlternatively, we could leverage AI models to script for us. For instance, we could ask for a Python script that composes the chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes. The output format could be something user-friendly like Lilypond or MusicXML.\nHere’s a sneak peek at a Python script:\ndef generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals():\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']\n    intervals = []\n\n    for i in range(len(notes)):\n        seventh_interval = (i + 10) % len(notes)\n        intervals.append((notes[i], notes[seventh_interval]))\n\n    return intervals\n\nprint(generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals())\nAnother feasible strategy might be to use AI models to generate Lilypond syntax.

This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.\n\n\n\nHere is a list of raw processes to be broken down.\n\n\nTo implement the requested changes, here are the modified instructions:\n\nCreating the avatar face: Utilizes digital drawing techniques to design and create the facial features of the avatar.\n\nInput mime type: None\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nChanging colors: Utilizes a digital paintbrush tool like Penpot to modify and customize the colors of the avatar.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nSelecting the best-looking avatars: Evaluates and chooses the most visually appealing avatars from a pool of options.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nRemoving the background image: Removes the background image to make rework easier. May provide worse results with edge details.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nAdding a body: Incorporates a body to the avatar using Blender’s CC0 base mesh or a similar tool.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nCreating a 3D model of the back of the avatar: If feasible, attempts to create a 3D model of the back of the avatar for a more comprehensive representation.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nSimplifying images: Uses a tool to simplify and refine the entire avatar image as a whole, removing any unnecessary image details or complexities.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nAdding clothing and accessories: Enhances the avatar by adding clothing and accessories using tools like Vroid Hub.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nPlacing the 2D image as a reference: Positions the 2D reference image in front of the 3D model to serve as a visual guide during customization.\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG), 3D model file (e.g., GLTF)\nOutput mime type: 3D model file (e.g., GLTF), Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\nCapturing and enhancing images: Captures images from various angles using a camera and enhances them to improve the overall quality.\n\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n\nGenerating text captions: Creates descriptive text captions for the captured images to provide additional context or information.\n\n\nInput mime type: Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: Text file (e.g., TXT)\n\n\nUsing a 2D reference image in Blender: Uses a 2D reference image within Blender to guide the customization process.\n\n\nInput mime type: Digital drawing/image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\nOutput mime type: 3D model file (e.g., GLTF), Digital image file (e.g., PNG, SVG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers will be able to create highly customizable avatars with specific features.\nThe avatar creation process will be enhanced with a variety of tools and techniques.\nDetailed customization of colors, clothing, accessories, and facial expressions will be possible.\nMotion capture capabilities can be integrated for more realistic animations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation process is complex and may require advanced technical skills from users.\nSome steps, like creating a 3D model of the back of the avatar, may not always be successful.\nPainting errors and other imperfections may remain in the final avatar.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcessive complexity or technical requirements: We want the avatar creation process to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, so any options that require advanced technical skills or have excessively complex customization controls will not be included.\n\n\n\n\nNo, the proposed enhancement involves a multi-step process that cannot be easily replicated with just a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nThe proposed enhancement addresses the limitations in V-Sekai’s avatar creation process, providing users with a comprehensive solution for creating highly customizable avatars.

Possible names for the new one is WASGOQuery and WASGO.\nAdvantages:\n\nWAMR wasn’t well liked because it’s written in c/c++ and because it’s not widely used.\nWASMTIME is widely used and used for commercial / financial applications\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nWASMTIME rust is hard to deploy\nWAMR is hard to use.\n\nOpen Questions:\nDoes it require determinism for clustering?\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nWe ONLY support floating point, integers, strings and byte arrays.\n\nCompile libsqlite\nAdd a wasm engine\nTyped:\nSave a UDF of the notification function of _notification as a string of arbitrary length\nreturns a row\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe can user script our worlds.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nWe cannot get other features in.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nKnowing what to do is hard.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nScriptability is a core feature.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nlibsql bindgen\nwasm udfs in sqlite"

    "title": "Proposed: Integrating Helm for Kubernetes Runner Installation with S3 Cache",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The V-Sekai project, focused on integrating social VR capabilities into the Godot Engine, necessitates a flexible and scalable CI/CD infrastructure to manage the development workflow across various environments effectively. Given the diversity of platforms our contributors use, including Linux, macOS, Windows, Docker, and Kubernetes, there is a critical need to standardize our CI/CD processes to ensure consistency and efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe current CI/CD setup at V-Sekai lacks a unified approach to deploying and managing runners in Kubernetes clusters, leading to potential inconsistencies in build and test environments. This fragmentation could slow down the development pipeline and impact the project’s ability to iterate rapidly on new features.\n\n\n\nWe propose to enhance our CI/CD pipeline by integrating Helm to streamline the installation and management of GitLab Runners in our Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, we will configure the runners to use S3 (Digital Ocean Spaces) as a cache, improving build times and reducing network traffic. Here’s how we plan to implement this solution:\n\n\nEnsure Helm is installed on your system. Helm will be used to deploy GitLab Runner instances as Helm charts, providing an easy and scalable way to manage runners within Kubernetes clusters.\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash\n\n\n\nAdd the GitLab Runner Helm chart repository to your Helm setup. This repository contains the necessary templates for deploying GitLab Runners in a Kubernetes cluster.\nhelm repo add gitlab https://charts.gitlab.io/\nhelm repo update\n\n\n\nUpdate your values.yaml file with the following values to switch to the Ubuntu-based image and configure S3 as a cache:\n# Specify the Ubuntu image.

    "text": "V-Sekai’s main goals and features:\nV-Sekai wants to make virtual collaboration easy for everyone by focusing on bringing people together and enabling creation.\nWith open voice and text chat, you can hang out and talk to others freely. Customize your VRM 1.0 avatar to represent yourself and feel like you’re among friends no matter where they are.\nOur simple spaces provide locations for any activity. You can discuss ideas in a casual lounge, brainstorm on interactive whiteboards, design together in a 3D workshop, or build fully customized environments.\nIn V-Sekai, you can express yourself by sharing and creating things together. You can doodle and prototype on the digital whiteboard or with 3D modeling tools. Bring in images, videos, web content, anything - then combine them into new inventions. You can create alone or with friends to keep improving each other’s work.\nWe know that new platforms need good tutorials. That’s why we make collaborating in V-Sekai simple, with friendly walkthroughs and a helpful community. We built this platform for you, and we listen and update regularly based on what the community wants to create.\nAt V-Sekai, we believe in open access. We are developing ways for outside creators to build new tools, spaces, and features that expand V-Sekai’s potential. We follow our values of empowering users, spreading joy, and helping shape this open world!\nV-Sekai provides space, freedom, and fertile ground for relationships to flourish. The essentials for hanging out with friends in a virtual world are simple enough for everyone yet open for spontaneous interaction and creating together. We build the foundation, and you provide the imagination. Join us in building the future of social VR!\nTo summarize, V-Sekai’s main objectives are:\n• Enabling open communication through voice/text chat and VRM 1.0 avatars\n• Providing simple, flexible spaces for any activity or collaboration\n• Sharing media, tools, and abilities to create together\n• Educating and supporting the community\n• Providing open access for user and creator contributions\n• Fostering human relationships and co-creation in virtual reality\n• Keeping the platform accessible to all while being open-ended enough for creativity\n• Building a foundation for connection focused on user experience\n• Developing an ecosystem where people power imagination and potential."

There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass method referred to as Shortcut.\n\n\nThe main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused). TressFX 4.1/Cauldron uses both Shortcut and PPLL.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nAvatars are a strength of V-Sekai.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nCode complexity.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nReduz isn’t interested in OIT.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/master/doc/TressFX4xDeveloperGuide.pdf\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXPPLL.hlsl\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXShortCut.hlsl\nhttps://blog.icare3d.org/2010/07/opengl-40-abuffer-v20-linked-lists-of.html\nhttps://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/oit/oit.cpp\n\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Developers often need to manage multiple terminal sessions at once, which can be challenging without the right tools.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to find a usable terminal multiplexer that can handle multiple terminal sessions efficiently and effectively.\n\n\n\nOur strategy is to use Byobu, a GPLv3 open source text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer. It was chosen for its ease of use and robust feature set.\n\n\n\nBy using Byobu, developers can easily manage multiple terminal sessions from a single interface.

    "text": "Blender is a powerful open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline. On the other hand, FDB-SQLite is a SQL layer built on top of the key-value store FoundationDB.

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, Cthulhoo, fire\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nA new game concept where players manage a college for magical girls has been proposed. Inspired by “Shadows of Doubt,” the game will focus on time management, relationship building, and academic success in a magical setting.\n\n\nShadows of Doubt on Steam\nA sandbox stealth game set in an alternate 1980s universe, blending detective work with gathering intelligence and solving cases.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop engaging planner scenarios for the player to navigate over the course of a week.\n\n\n\nUtilize VRM 3D chibis for character representation; initially limiting characters to five core members:\n\nThe Protagonist\nFour love interests\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents can earn study points by:\n\nAttending lectures\nCompleting homework\nStudying in the library\nEngaging in practical exercises\n\n\n\n\nCharacters can build relationships through activities:\n\nEating at the mess hall (easy, small benefit)\nGrabbing coffee together (small benefit)\nWatching movies at the cinema (moderate difficulty and benefit)\nHanging out at the pool (moderately challenging, moderate benefit)\nPicnicking in the park (challenging, moderate benefit)\nBeach trips (most challenging, high benefit)\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent burnout, students can:\n\nRead books\nPartake in hobbies\nParticipate in club activities\nEngage in chaste handholding\n\nSpecial considerations are given to individual preferences affecting decision outcomes, such as preferred or disliked activities impacting the willingness to participate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurnout Management: A single meter may represent stamina and morale, balancing academic and social demands.\nPlanning Interface: Players plan weekly activities that unfold in real-time, adapting to emergent scenarios and random events.\nDuration: Each playthrough is one week long, split into weekdays and weekends, offering a chance to assess and strategize for the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\nThis simulator offers a unique blend of time management, relationship simulation, and supernatural elements that appeal to various gaming audiences.\n\n\n\nComplex AI planning and character interaction mechanics could pose development challenges.\n\n\n\nThe decision to exclude a Pokemon-style battle system indicates a conscious move away from combat-oriented gameplay in favor of a simulation that emphasizes time management and social interactions within an academic setting. This choice differentiates the game from typical fantasy or RPG genres, focusing instead on daily life and relationship dynamics amongst magical girls.\nAlternative paths that were not taken might include:\n\nComplex combat systems with magical abilities.\nAn overarching narrative driven by external conflicts or villains.\nExpansion of the school’s supernatural elements beyond academic settings into broader world-saving quests.\n\nBy not pursuing these elements, the game remains intimate, allowing players to deeply explore the nuances of daily decisions and their impacts on personal growth and friendships.\n\n\n\nThough primary focus lies on managing relationships and academics within the college, rare use cases might involve:\n\nHandling exceptional magical crises that disrupt the normal flow of school life, requiring strategic changes to weekly planning.\nSpecial events such as magical tournaments or festivals, where characters must balance celebration with responsibilities.\nUnique narrative branches that only occur under specific conditions, adding replayability and depth to the character arcs.\n\nAddressing infrequent use cases can add layers of complexity and engagement for players, offering surprises and challenges that disrupt the routine management aspects of the game.\n\n\n\nThe V-Sekai team will decide core features and their implementation internally.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai GitHub Account\nV-Sekai Game Repository\n\nAI assistant Aria contributed to this proposal."

    "text": "Implement “An Algorithm for Triangulating Multiple 3D Polygons”\nUse Godot’s delaunay tetrahedralize https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/96d7bc62af25b85b8b9cc091eeea1e7a784ba624/core/math/delaunay_3d.h#L145 static Vector&lt;OutputSimplex&gt; tetrahedralize(const Vector&lt;Vector3&gt; &p_points)\nEmilie Yu described a method for smoothing meshes.\n\nLibigl should be best for smoothing while pinning the boundaries. I see they have a solver that can take fixed boundary constraints https://libigl.github.io/tutorial/#quadratic-energy-minimization so that could allow you to pin the boundaries. So instead of this line it would be something like\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_data mqwf;\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_precompute(S, [flat vector of indices of boundary vertices size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero matrix], true, mqwf);\nigl::min_quad_with_fixed_solve(mqwf, M * U, [flat vector of boundary vertices positions size=(3 * N_boundary)], [zero vector], Z);\nand the vector Z is a (3 * N) flat vector of the solution vertices (equivalent to the “U” of the other example).\n\n??? Add remeshing.\nExpose a function to Godot Engine called triangulate boundaries."

How can we improve the workflow to better maintain the project’s organization and compatibility?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nImplement a Git subrepo management system to separate assets and libraries, enabling easier tracking and synchronization between branches. This solution streamlines the development proces\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nConfigure the Git subrepo to automatically update and synchronize with the main project.\nUse the Git subrepo in each branch to maintain consistent asset and library versions.\nAvoid storing godot and modules inside of the v-sekai-game.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nImproved organization and compatibility of assets and libraries across branches.\nSimplified workflow for project updates and synchronization.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nPotential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Git subrepo management.\nPossible limitations in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nWorkarounds using scripts may be possible, but they are likely to be less efficient and more prone to errors compared to a Git subrepo management system.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot a few lines of code. It is also devops.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIntegrating a Git subrepo management system as a core feature ensures consistency and maintainability across the entire V-Sekai project. It promotes better collaboration among team members and streamlines the development process.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nGit Subrepo Documentation"

Each stage builds upon the previous one, gradually expanding the project’s scope and capabilities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\n\n  subgraph Short Term\n    A[Avatar Loading] --&gt; B1[Simple Demo with VRM Avatar]\n    A --&gt; B2[VRM & Unity Import - Maintain and Improve]\n    A --&gt; B3[Network Code Reconciliation - Godot Network System]\n    A --&gt; B4[Jitter in Network Interpolation]\n    A --&gt; B5[Implement jitter and playback buffer for Voice]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Mid Term\n    B4 --&gt; C[Network]\n    C --&gt; D1[Entity System & Background Loading]\n    C --&gt; D2[Background Loading - Re-evaluate with Multithreaded Scene Tree]\n    C --&gt; D3[UI Work - Fix VR UI & Improve Interaction]\n    C --&gt; D4[Lightweight Relay Instance Server - Single Process, Multiple Instances]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Long Term\n    D4 --&gt; E[Scalable Instances]\n    E --&gt; F1[Network Topology Implementation]\n    E --&gt; F2[Streamlined Content Creation - Better Workflow]\n    E --&gt; F3[Zero Stutter when Loading Content - Address Bottlenecks]\n    E --&gt; F4[Social and Upload Features - Enhance User Experience]\n    E --&gt; F5[Video and Audio Work - Streaming Integration]\n    E --&gt; F6[Scripting Integrations - WASM-based Scripts]\n    E --&gt; F7[UX Work for Non-Technical Users - Accessible UI]\n    E --&gt; F8[Loading VRM Avatars - Streamlined Process]\n    E --&gt; F9[In-Editor Content Building UX - Non-Technical Users]\n  end\nThe discussion involves the development of V-Sekai, a project with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. In the short term, the focus is on avatar loading, simple demos, VRM & Unity import, network code reconciliation, adding network interpolation, and voice jitter buffer. Mid-term goals include working on the network, entity system, background loading, UI improvements, and developing a lightweight relay instance server. Finally, long-term goals involve scalable instances, network topology implementation, streamlined content creation, zero stutter loading, enhancing social and upload features, video and music playback and live streaming, scripting integrations, UX work for non-technical users, and in-editor content building UX.\nOne challenge the project faces is maintaining and improving the existing codebase, which includes outdated workarounds from Godot 3. Another setback was the change from OpenVR to OpenXR. Content is another hurdle: transferring a world from other platforms to V-Sekai is currently best accomplished by exporting source assets such as glTF or FBX. The project aims to cater to non-technical users, making it more accessible than other platforms. WASM-based scripting is being considered, but there are concerns about implementation challenges and security.\nIn addition, the V-Sekai project needs a project manager, and the team struggles to find collaborators who share their vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute significantly. Nevertheless, despite the long list of features needed for basic functionality, the team believes that V-Sekai is essential for the future of the Metaverse space, and that will draw collaborators to assist on our common vision.\nIt’s important that our roadmap and goals continue to be discussed and iterated on. Nothing should be seen as final, since technology changes so rapidly and consensus is important.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe can create V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nOverhead might be hard.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nRelying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\nContinuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo. This is a process.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

In particular, the dynamic_shapes and simple_embedding samples showcase how to run on your choice of target. The input program may have a signature in the stablehlo dialect, and you can use IREE or XLA depending on your preferred tech stack or runtime requirements. The Vulkan stack in IREE is relatively stable and offers good performance, with nod.ai’s SHARK offering extra tuning and APIs on top. However, there may be differences in optimization depending on the workload and potential driver bugs and pitfalls.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nProvide IREE to godot engine.\nUses the Vulkan back end.\n\ninput_count\ninput/0/data (TypedArray)\noutput_count\noutput/0/data (TypedArray)\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nHave a playground for testing.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDon’t use onnx because it doesn’t have vulkan support which limits reach.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot a small number of gdscript lines.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nI know how, and no one else is doing it.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nSHARK\nIREE in-tree samples: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples\nIREE extra/more complex samples: https://github.com/iree-org/iree-samples\nIREE dynamic shapes sample: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples/dynamic_shapes\nIREE CPU/Vulkan/CUDA sample: https://github.com/openxla/iree/tree/main/samples/simple_embedding\nXLA axpy example: https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/examples/axpy\nnod.ai SHARK: https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK\nnod.ai SHARK results on AMD GPUs using Vulkan: https://nod.ai/sd-rdna3-ces2023/"

    "text": "Proposed: Merge retargeting feature into Godot Engine master\n\nDescribe the status of the issue.\nSuperceded by the https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/issues/229 proposal.\n\n\nList the deciders of the issue.\nV-Sekai,tokage,fire,lyuma\n\n\nDescribe the tags of the issue.\nV-Sekai,animation,retargeting,\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nWe want to share animations among different skeletons.\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nUse tokage’s animation retargeting.\n\nLyuma’s explanations\nFirst of all, Local (rest) and Absolute modes are not good enough for most of the common retargeting cases. As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the “silhouette” of the model.\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can’t say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz’s idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage’s diagram.\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you’re going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\nfrom what I can understand, “2” is what Tokage is proposing. I don’t see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don’t see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n\n\n158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee pull request.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nSharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nThe feature is hard to do.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

    "text": "Status: rejected \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,networking,\n\n\n\n\nOur project involves a distributed simulation system where maintaining strong consistency and efficient workload distribution are important requirements. We are currently facing the challenge of how to handle authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers without incurring high network hop counts and latency.\nSomeone invited me to a popular VR platform and gave me a 20-minute tour, just enough to learn how to in desktop mode create a world, import an object, and inspector-edit it. So I imported our celebration map, and the map loaded in 20 seconds. I was able to change its transform. I’m still thinking about that experience.\n\n\n\nWe propose to use a metadata system with Khepri instances and Raft consensus algorithm to manage ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes. Homeservers will manage metadata using their own Khepri instances within a Raft cluster, while simulation servers, including player simulation servers, will maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer will be initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure will be updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates will be exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nBy monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers, we can balance the system and ensure fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers will ensure efficient workload distribution and enhance the overall gaming experience.\nWe believe that this approach will provide strong consistency guarantees, access control, and scalability while minimizing network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeserver: A server responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes.\nSimulation server: A server responsible for containing game entity nodes it has authority over, including player simulation servers.\nKhepri: A tree-like replicated on-disk database library for Erlang and Elixir, used for maintaining a nested path-to-value store.\nRaft cluster: A cluster of servers implementing the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure strong consistency and fault tolerance.\nOwnership: The player who has control over a game entity and can change its state.\nMastership: The authority that can change ownership rules and default ownership settings.\nAsk, Deny, Allow: Rules set by the Master for ownership transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach type of server can only be Khepri members of the same type.\nEach server can only allow be Khepri members of the same logical instance.\nRaft is only active inside of each logical instance.\nHomeserver servers are REST + JSON and the cheap pattern.\nSimulation servers are using the nasty state transfer pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nAction\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to the home server to fetch the public key of Player B.\n\n\n2\nThe home server retrieves Player B’s public key from its database and sends it back to Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n3\nPlayer A’s simulation server uses Player B’s public key to encrypt a message or binary data.\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s simulation server signs the encrypted message or binary data using its own private key.\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends the encrypted message or binary data along with the digital signature to Player B’s simulation server using the membrane_udp_plugin.\n\n\n6\nPlayer B’s simulation server receives the message and verifies the digital signature using Player A’s public key, which it retrieves from the home server.\n\n\n7\nIf the signature is valid, Player B’s simulation server uses its own private key to decrypt the message and obtain the original data sent by Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n8\nIf the message is confidential, Player B’s simulation server may want to send a response back to Player A’s simulation server using a similar protocol, with Player A’s public key retrieved from the home server.\n\n\n\nThis table outlines the steps of the communication protocol between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers, which involves retrieving public keys from the home server’s database, encrypting and signing messages, and verifying digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of the messages. This protocol ensures secure and confidential communication between the two simulation servers, allowing for safe and reliable data exchange.\n# EC examples\nalice_private_jwk = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-alice.pem\")\nalice_public_jwk  = JOSE.JWK.to_public(alice_private_jwk)\nbob_private_jwk   = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-bob.pem\")\nbob_public_jwk    = JOSE.JWK.to_public(bob_private_jwk)\n\n## Encrypt and Decrypt (defaults to ECDH-ES with A128GCM)\n### Alice sends Bob a secret message using Bob's public key and Alice's private key\nalice_to_bob = \"For Bob's eyes only.\"\nencrypted = JOSE.JWK.box_encrypt(alice_to_bob, bob_public_jwk, alice_private_jwk)\n### Only Bob can decrypt the message using his private key (Alice's public key is embedded in the JWE header)\n{^alice_to_bob, _} = JOSE.JWK.box_decrypt(encrypted, bob_private_jwk)\n\n\n\nIn a distributed simulation system, maintaining separate roles for homeservers and simulation servers and using a metadata system with strong consistency guarantees is crucial. Homeservers are responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes, using a Khepri instance within a Raft cluster. Simulation servers, including player simulation servers, maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure is updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nMonitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers allows for balancing the system and ensuring fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers ensures efficient workload distribution and enhances the overall gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\nCase 1: Authority transfer from Player A to Player B on a different home server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority request to Player B’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s homeserver sends a response to Player A’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority response to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nSending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server may not be necessary, as the authority request can be sent directly to Player B’s homeserver without waiting for confirmation.\nTotal hops: 3 + 2 * H\nCase 2: Authority transfer if Player A’s and Player B’s homeservers are exactly the same\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends a response directly to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nTotal hops: 3\nIn this optimized process, we have removed sending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server. This acknowledgment may not be necessary, as the response can be sent directly to Player B’s simulation server without waiting for confirmation. By removing this step, we reduce the total hop count by 1, potentially improving the efficiency of the authority transfer process when both players are on the same home server.\nCase 3: Direct communication between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers on the same home server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an update directly to Player B’s simulation server using a hand-optimized binary layout and an asynchronous communication model.\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server using credit-based flow control or another asynchronous technique.\n1\n\n\n\nIn this modified version of Case 3, both the update and acknowledgment steps employ the high-performance communication system’s features. This includes using hand-optimized binary layouts for data transfer and asynchronous communication techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. The total hop count remains the same at 2 hops.\n\n\n\nStrong consistency guarantees\nAccess control over Khepri instances\nScalability\nMinimized network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity: The proposed system involves multiple components, such as homeservers, simulation servers, Khepri instances, and Raft clusters. Managing and maintaining these components can be complex and may require significant development effort.\nPerformance: The use of Raft consensus algorithm ensures strong consistency but may introduce performance overhead due to the need for communication between nodes in the cluster. This could impact the overall performance of the distributed simulation system.\nScalability: While the proposal aims to provide scalability, it is not clear how well the system will scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows. Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\nSecurity: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\nFault tolerance: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system’s resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.\nSynchronization: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer. However, it does not provide details on how this synchronization process works, which could be a critical aspect of the system’s functionality.\nLoad balancing: Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers is essential for balancing the system. However, the proposal does not provide specific details on how load balancing will be achieved or what metrics will be used to determine when to add or remove servers from the system.\n\n\n\n\nWe considered using a client-server model for the distributed simulation system but found that it would not provide the strong consistency guarantees and access control we require, and it would also be more difficult to scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows.\n\n\n\nThis is not a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nI am exploring alternatives for the current implementation of the client-server model.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nKhepri documentation: https://github.com/rabbitmq/khepri\nRaft consensus algorithm: https://raft.github.io/\nNetworked Physics in Virtual Reality: https://gafferongames.com/post/networked_physics_in_virtual_reality/\nChapter 7 - Advanced Architecture using ZeroMQ: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter7/"

Managing and maintaining these components can be complex and may require significant development effort.\nPerformance: The use of Raft consensus algorithm ensures strong consistency but may introduce performance overhead due to the need for communication between nodes in the cluster. This could impact the overall performance of the distributed simulation system.\nScalability: While the proposal aims to provide scalability, it is not clear how well the system will scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows. Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\nSecurity: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\nFault tolerance: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system’s resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.\nSynchronization: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer. However, it does not provide details on how this synchronization process works, which could be a critical aspect of the system’s functionality.\nLoad balancing: Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers is essential for balancing the system. However, the proposal does not provide specific details on how load balancing will be achieved or what metrics will be used to determine when to add or remove servers from the system.\n\n\n\n\nWe considered using a client-server model for the distributed simulation system but found that it would not provide the strong consistency guarantees and access control we require, and it would also be more difficult to scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows.\n\n\n\nThis is not a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nI am exploring alternatives for the current implementation of the client-server model.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nKhepri documentation: https://github.com/rabbitmq/khepri\nRaft consensus algorithm: https://raft.github.io/\nNetworked Physics in Virtual Reality: https://gafferongames.com/post/networked_physics_in_virtual_reality/\nChapter 7 - Advanced Architecture using ZeroMQ: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter7/"

    "text": "Rejected: Package Godot for pkgin\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: rejected \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nAccording to Netflix, the BSD-type operating systems are competitive, and supporting pkgsrc is an excellent way to start.\n\npkgsrc is a framework for managing third-party software on UNIX-like systems containing over 26,000 packages. It is the default package manager of NetBSD and SmartOS and can be used to enable freely available software to be built quickly on a large number of other UNIX-like platforms.\n\n\nV-Sekai is developing a free, open-source virtual reality platform. We work to make it user-friendly and fulfill a need in the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nEffortless installation and updates: Packaging Godot Engine for pkgin makes it easier to install and update the software on macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, offering a smooth experience for users at all expertise levels.\nWider platform support: By embracing pkgsrc and packaging Godot Engine for pkgin, compatibility with an array of UNIX-like systems is ensured, broadening the user base and fostering adoption across different platforms.\nPromoting cooperation: V-Sekai’s support for pkgsrc and packaging of the Godot Engine for pkgin enables collaboration through the vast third-party software ecosystem available for UNIX-like systems, stimulating the exchange of ideas and resources.\nReinforcing open-source ideals: V-Sekai’s decision to package the Godot Engine for pkgin strengthens its commitment to open-source values like accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, enhancing growth within the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\nA[Godot Engine Source Code] --&gt; B[Build and Package]\nB --&gt; C[Godot Engine pkgin Package]\nC --&gt; D{Platform Compatibility}\nD --&gt; E[macOS]\nD --&gt; F[Linux]\nD --&gt; G[NetBSD]\nC --&gt; H[Package Repository]\nI[User] --&gt; J[pkgin command]\nJ --&gt; H\nH --&gt; K[Install/Update Godot Engine]\nK --&gt; I\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEasy installation and updates: Pkgin support simplifies installing and updating the Godot Engine on UNIX-like systems, such as macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, providing a hassle-free experience for users.\nWide platform support: Pkgin compatibility ensures that the Godot Engine works seamlessly with multiple UNIX-like systems, expanding the user base and promoting adoption across various platforms.\nEfficient dependency handling: Pkgin automatically manages dependencies, streamlining the installation process and minimizing conflicts or issues due to unmet requirements.\nUniform software environment: Pkgin helps maintain consistency in software versions and configurations, which is crucial for collaboration and reducing the need for troubleshooting.\nConnection to the pkgsrc ecosystem: Supporting pkgin allows users to tap into the extensive third-party software ecosystem for UNIX-like systems, fostering the exchange of ideas and resources within the open-source community.\nResource and time savings: By offering pkgin support, developers can concentrate on enhancing the Godot Engine and V-Sekai’s VR platform features rather than manually managing software installations and updates.\nEmphasizing open-source principles: By endorsing pkgin, both V-Sekai and the Godot Engine reaffirm their commitment to open-source values, such as accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, fostering growth and collaboration within the VR community.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nThere are some potential downsides to packaging the Godot Engine for pkgin, which include:\nAdditional maintenance work: Supporting pkgin may necessitate regular package updates to ensure compatibility with different systems and to keep up with new Godot Engine versions and features. This could require extra time and resources from the development team.\nIncomplete platform support: Pkgin is designed for UNIX-like systems, but it doesn’t directly cater to users on other platforms, such as Windows. Supporting alternative package managers for non-UNIX platforms may demand extra efforts.\nUser learning curve: Users unfamiliar with pkgin or pkgsrc might need to invest time in learning to use the package manager effectively, which could pose a barrier for some users, particularly those new to UNIX-like systems or with limited package management experience.\nPotential compatibility challenges: While pkgin aims to provide compatibility across various UNIX-like systems, certain configurations or system setups may still pose difficulties. Addressing these issues might require more development and troubleshooting efforts.\nUnnecessary overhead for small projects: For smaller projects or users with minimal requirements, the added features and capabilities provided by pkgin support might be excessive. In such cases, the effort needed to maintain and use a pkgin package could outweigh its benefits.\nDespite these potential downsides, offering pkgin support can bring significant advantages, such as streamlining installation and updates, ensuring compatibility with UNIX-like systems, and promoting collaboration within the open-source community.\n\n\nOption graveyard\nAlternative package managers: While other package managers like apt or yum might have been considered, they may need to provide different compatibility with BSD-type systems than pkgsrc. Pkgin, designed for pkgsrc, is the default package manager for systems like NetBSD and SmartOS, making it the ideal choice.\nManual installation: Requiring users to compile and install Godot Engine manually would complicate the process and be less user-friendly, particularly for novices. This approach could also result in software version inconsistencies and configuration issues, affecting user experience.\nCustom package manager: Developing a custom package manager specifically for V-Sekai’s platform is resource-intensive and duplicates existing package managers’ efforts, such as pkgin, which already offers compatibility with BSD-type systems.\nExclusively focusing on other platforms: By targeting only Linux, macOS, or Windows, V-Sekai would limit its potential user base and overlook the advantages of supporting UNIX-like systems like NetBSD and SmartOS. So instead, packaging Godot Engine for pkgin enables V-Sekai to reach a wider audience using BSD-type operating systems.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nUsing a script for Godot Engine may have drawbacks, such as being less user-friendly, requiring more maintenance, having limited compatibility with BSD-type systems, and potentially impacting integration with the pkgsrc ecosystem.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nPackaging the Godot Engine for pkgin as a core task our team handles ensures quality control, streamlined support, customization, alignment with your platform’s vision, and trust-building with users. These factors contribute to the overall success and adoption of your open-source virtual reality platform.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://pkgsrc.joyent.com/"

However, this method can often lead to information overload and important details may get lost in the process.\n\n\n\nThis strategy may not be as effective in smaller teams or projects where communication is more direct and less formal.\n\n\n\nYes, this strategy should be implemented by us as it aligns with our goal of improving communication and project management within the team.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nI’m OK; The Bull Is Dead\nThis article is assisted by AI."

When Server synchronizes, if P2 were to have the ball in a different location then P1, the Server would tell P2 that the Ball is in the location P1 has it, and would do the same for P3. It can be thought of as a mutex on the state of the Ball. Whoever holds the Mutex is the one who can modify the state therein. This also means that all calculations for game state are split up among all the players, every player only has to run code modifying what they own, which in large scale player events would otherwise increase exponentially with custom scripts for each player’s props or avatars.\n\n\n\nThis presents a problem however, how could P2 take the Ball from P1? The solution is Mastership. Whoever is the Master can change who is the Owner at any time. The Master also can change whatever the default Rule is, which is what the Server, and Client references when looking to change Ownership to itself (or someone else?).\n\nAsk: Take a round trip to the Master and back to the Server so the Master can decide based on external factors whether or not to allow ownership transfer or deny it. This could be used for example, if someone only wants a gun to be grabbable if they are a “shooter” and not if they are a “civilian”\nDeny: You cannot ask for ownership transfer, good for things like Avatar’s transform node, you don’t wanna be involuntarily moved around, or for the root of the world map.\nAllow: You can ask for ownership any time, and it is automatically granted.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the rate of synchronization based on the closest clients owned model, and other things like that, there are a lot of areas for optimization when it comes to using this.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Latency for Competitive/Real-Time interactions\nLow processing power on both the server and client side\nBroad enough to be easily modifiable for optimizations in the future without changing the model\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity, we will have to code this all from scratch basically\nMulti-user interactions become impossible on a single object, at least to do simply, some smart coding could get around it but it isn’t easy to do.\nResolutions for the allow rule could lead to inconsistencies, such as two different people picking up a gun and firing it, and two resulting bullets being spawned from the same gun before it gets removed from one individual.\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely, this is the foundation of basically everything content wise in V-sekai.\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/blob/master/decisions/2020/20200729-entity-networking.md\nMalek’s forum post on networking in the Discord server.\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It details an AI framework and production pipeline that allow designers to craft huge amount of AI archetypes quickly and flexibly. Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\nhttps://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\nhttps://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\nhttps://baserow.io/\nhttps://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Ensure all messages are replicated to all connected clients.\n\n\nDuring these tests, we’ll monitor:\n\nLoad times for initial connections and reconnections.\nThroughput and latency of message delivery.\nServer resource usage (CPU, RAM, Network I/O).\nAny errors or dropped connections that occur.\n\nAll relevant events should be timestamped and logged to a centralized logging system for analysis.\n\n\n\nBy conducting this research, we aim to:\n\nIdentify the most scalable and efficient networking strategy for the V-Sekai project.\nGather empirical data to inform future development decisions.\nContribute findings back to the wider Godot community to aid in similar multiplayer projects.\n\n\n\n\nPotential risks and drawbacks include:\n\nTime and resources required for test setup and execution.\nInterpretation of results may vary, leading to indecision.\nPossible discovery of fundamental issues that could delay project timelines.\n\n\n\n\nThis section will detail alternative methods and practices considered but ultimately not chosen, with justifications for their exclusion.\n\n\n\nWe will also explore less common user scenarios that may have unique performance characteristics under each networking strategy.\n\n\n\nDiscussion on whether the outcomes of this initiative should be integrated into the core V-Sekai codebase or maintained as separate modules.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine.\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine.\n\nThis design document was completed with assistance from AI developer Aria."

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nMeshGPT uses a transformer model trained on geometric vocabulary to generate triangle meshes, resulting in clean, coherent, and compact meshes.\n\n\n\nAdapting GPT-like generative models for the 3D domain is a challenge. Automated triangle mesh generation needs a robust solution.\n\n\n\nThe MeshRWKV model employs a sequence-based approach that autoregressively generates triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. The conversion process to RWKV4 can be broken down into two primary steps:\n\n\nThe initial step involves learning a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes from a large collection of 3D object meshes. This enables the encoding and decoding of triangles from this embedding.\nA graph convolution encoder, specifically a series of SAGE-Conv graph convolution layers, is utilized in this process. This encoder processes the mesh in the form of a face graph. For each graph node, input features include the positionally encoded 9 coordinates of the face triangle, its area, the angles between its edges, and the normal of the face.\nThese geometrically rich features capture the intricate details of 3D shapes and are quantized as embeddings of a codebook using residual quantization. This effectively reduces the sequence lengths of the mesh representation.\nThese embeddings are then sequenced and decoded by a 1D ResNet-34 network, which interprets the face features as a 1D sequence. It outputs logits corresponding to the 9 discrete coordinates of each face triangle. The size of the codebook C and the discretization space are determined based on the specific requirements and constraints of the model.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to train RWKV4, which leverages these quantized geometric embeddings. Given a sequence of geometric embeddings extracted from the triangles of a mesh, the transformer is trained to predict the codebook index of the next embedding in the sequence.\nOnce trained, the transformer can be auto-regressively sampled to predict sequences of embeddings. These embeddings can then be decoded to generate novel and diverse mesh structures that display efficient, irregular triangulations similar to human-crafted meshes.\n\n\n\nMeshGPT has made significant strides in the field of direct mesh generation, but it is not without its limitations. The autoregressive nature of the model results in slower sampling performance, with mesh generation times ranging from 30 to 90 seconds. The MeshGPT team’s learned tokenization approach has been successful in reducing sequence lengths for single object generation, but it may not be as effective when applied to scene-scale generation. This presents an opportunity for future enhancement.\nFurthermore, MeshGPT’s current computational resources restrict it to using the GPT2-medium transformer, which is less sophisticated than models like Llama2. Given that larger language models tend to benefit from increased data and computational power, expanding these resources could significantly enhance MeshGPT’s performance and capabilities.\nIt’s important to note that the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) model’s context size is significantly larger than that of GPT2. In machine learning, context size refers to the amount of information from previous steps that a model can consider while making predictions for the next step. It essentially determines how much ‘memory’ the model has about past data.\nThe larger context size of RWKV means that it can remember and utilize more past information while generating outputs. This feature potentially enables it to handle larger and more complex tasks, provided there are sufficient computational resources.\nHowever, a larger context size also implies higher computational demands. More processing power and memory are required to store and manage such large amounts of data. This could pose challenges in terms of hardware requirements and efficiency, particularly when dealing with very large datasets or complex tasks.\n\n\n\n\nOur approach produces compact meshes with sharp geometric details. It can suggest multiple shape completions for incomplete shapes.\n\n\n\nGiven that the MeshGPT model has already developed a process for converting mesh data into logits, this simplifies the task of applying the MeshRWKV model to skeletal animation.\nThe fundamental concept would involve representing a sequence of animation frames (from frame0 to frameN) as meshes. The recursive nature of RWKV could potentially offer significant advantages in this scenario. It might facilitate efficient encoding and decoding of sequential frames, which could lead to the generation of smooth and coherent animations.\nWith the mesh-to-logits conversion challenge addressed by MeshGPT, the primary focus can be on developing new training methodologies and loss functions tailored for animation data. This approach could significantly broaden the applicability of the MeshRWKV model, opening up exciting possibilities for future research and development in the field of 3D animation.\n\n\n\nTraining the model may require significant computational resources. Learning a vocabulary for triangle meshes could be complex.\n\n\n\nOther methods like neural field-based approaches exist but often miss geometric details or produce over-triangulated meshes.\n\n\n\nGenerating complex 3D shapes for niche applications might need additional model training or fine-tuning.\n\n\n\nYes, this proposal is core to our work at V-Sekai and will be implemented by us.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game\nMeshGPT\nObjaverse-XL\nNous-Hermes-2-Vision\nMachine Learning in Elixir\nPyTorch Geometric SAGEConv\nInductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs\n\nAssisted by AI assistant Aria."

    "section": "",
    "text": "V-Sekai is committed to enhancing data integrity, optimizing database performance, and standardizing data storage practices. To achieve these goals, we propose the adoption of the Essential Tuple Normalization Form (ETNF) across our database systems.\n\n\n\nCurrently, V-Sekai’s database systems lack a standardized approach to normalization. This leads to data redundancy, inconsistency, and inefficiencies in data management, which can hamper system performance and scalability.\n\n\n\nWe propose implementing ETNF, a normalization form that strikes an optimal balance between eliminating redundancy and maintaining manageable complexity in database schemas. Positioned between the fourth normal form (4NF) and the fifth normal form (5NF), ETNF provides a sophisticated yet practical approach to database normalization.\n\n\nA relation schema R is in Essential Tuple Normal Form (ETNF) if every tuple in every instance of R is essential. This means that no tuple in the database can be generated from other tuples, thus eliminating redundancy.\nIn mathematical terms, a relation R is in ETNF if and only if it is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and some component of every explicit join dependency (JD) of R is a superkey. Specifically, for every nontrivial join dependency {R1, R2, …, Rn} that holds over R, the intersection of each pair of Ri and Rj is a superkey for at least one of Ri or Rj.\nThis concept is further illustrated by the theorem stating that if R is a relation schema specified only by functional dependencies (FDs) and join dependencies (JDs), then R is in ETNF if and only if it is in BCNF and some component of every explicit JD of R is a superkey.\nTherefore, ETNF is an effective normalization form that reduces data redundancy while maintaining manageable complexity in database schemas. It provides a balance between the elimination of unnecessary redundancy and the avoidance of extensive decomposition associated with higher normal forms like 5NF.\n\n\nConsider a V-Sekai database table storing information about parts, suppliers, and respective shipments. The table is not normalized and contains redundant data.\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nSupplierName\nPartID\nPartName\nShipmentQuantity\n\n\n\n\nS1\nAlice\nP1\nPart1\n100\n\n\nS1\nAlice\nP2\nPart2\n200\n\n\nS2\nBob\nP1\nPart1\n150\n\n\nS2\nBob\nP3\nPart3\n300\n\n\nS3\nCharlie\nP2\nPart2\n250\n\n\n\nIn this table, SupplierName and PartName are repeated for each SupplierID and PartID, respectively. This redundancy can lead to inconsistencies and anomalies.\n\n\n\nTo normalize the above table into ETNF, we would decompose it into three separate tables: Supplier, Part, and Shipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nSupplierName\n\n\n\n\nS1\nAlice\n\n\nS2\nBob\n\n\nS3\nCharlie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartID\nPartName\n\n\n\n\nP1\nPart1\n\n\nP2\nPart2\n\n\nP3\nPart3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nPartID\nShipmentQuantity\n\n\n\n\nS1\nP1\n100\n\n\nS1\nP2\n200\n\n\nS2\nP1\n150\n\n\nS2\nP3\n300\n\n\nS3\nP2\n250\n\n\n\nIn these normalized tables, each tuple is essential and there is no redundancy. The SupplierName is not repeated for each shipment from the same supplier, and similarly, the PartName is not repeated for each shipment of the same part. This design adheres to the principles of ETNF, enhancing data integrity and consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedundancy Reduction: ETNF effectively reduces data redundancy by ensuring that all data stored in the database is essential and non-repetitive.\nData Integrity and Consistency: By minimizing redundancy, ETNF enhances the integrity and consistency of the database, making data more reliable and accurate.\nBalanced Complexity: ETNF offers a middle ground between 4NF and 5NF, reducing redundancy without the complexity of decomposing relations into smaller, more numerous relations as often required by 5NF.\n\n\n\n\n\nDependency Analysis: The first step involves a detailed analysis of all functional and join dependencies across the database to identify redundancy and determine the scope for normalization to ETNF.\nSchema Evaluation and Restructuring: Evaluate existing database schemas against ETNF criteria, identifying areas where restructuring is required to eliminate redundancy and enhance efficiency.\nPractical Application and Migration: Implement the ETNF principles through schema redesign and careful data migration, ensuring that the transition does not impact data integrity or system availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced Data Integrity: Implementation of ETNF will significantly improve the integrity and reliability of V-Sekai’s data.\nOptimized Performance: By reducing redundancy, ETNF will streamline data storage and retrieval processes, enhancing overall system performance.\nStrategic Data Management: Adopting ETNF aligns with strategic initiatives for scalable, efficient, and consistent data management practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nA normal form for preventing redundant tuples in relational databases\n\nAI assistant Aria assisted with this article."

    "title": "Proposed: Implementation of Essential Tuple Normalization Form (ETNF) for relational databases (rdbms, sql)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We propose implementing ETNF, a normalization form that strikes an optimal balance between eliminating redundancy and maintaining manageable complexity in database schemas. Positioned between the fourth normal form (4NF) and the fifth normal form (5NF), ETNF provides a sophisticated yet practical approach to database normalization.\n\n\nA relation schema R is in Essential Tuple Normal Form (ETNF) if every tuple in every instance of R is essential. This means that no tuple in the database can be generated from other tuples, thus eliminating redundancy.\nIn mathematical terms, a relation R is in ETNF if and only if it is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and some component of every explicit join dependency (JD) of R is a superkey. Specifically, for every nontrivial join dependency {R1, R2, …, Rn} that holds over R, the intersection of each pair of Ri and Rj is a superkey for at least one of Ri or Rj.\nThis concept is further illustrated by the theorem stating that if R is a relation schema specified only by functional dependencies (FDs) and join dependencies (JDs), then R is in ETNF if and only if it is in BCNF and some component of every explicit JD of R is a superkey.\nTherefore, ETNF is an effective normalization form that reduces data redundancy while maintaining manageable complexity in database schemas. It provides a balance between the elimination of unnecessary redundancy and the avoidance of extensive decomposition associated with higher normal forms like 5NF.\n\n\nConsider a V-Sekai database table storing information about parts, suppliers, and respective shipments. The table is not normalized and contains redundant data.\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nSupplierName\nPartID\nPartName\nShipmentQuantity\n\n\n\n\nS1\nAlice\nP1\nPart1\n100\n\n\nS1\nAlice\nP2\nPart2\n200\n\n\nS2\nBob\nP1\nPart1\n150\n\n\nS2\nBob\nP3\nPart3\n300\n\n\nS3\nCharlie\nP2\nPart2\n250\n\n\n\nIn this table, SupplierName and PartName are repeated for each SupplierID and PartID, respectively. This redundancy can lead to inconsistencies and anomalies.\n\n\n\nTo normalize the above table into ETNF, we would decompose it into three separate tables: Supplier, Part, and Shipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nSupplierName\n\n\n\n\nS1\nAlice\n\n\nS2\nBob\n\n\nS3\nCharlie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartID\nPartName\n\n\n\n\nP1\nPart1\n\n\nP2\nPart2\n\n\nP3\nPart3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplierID\nPartID\nShipmentQuantity\n\n\n\n\nS1\nP1\n100\n\n\nS1\nP2\n200\n\n\nS2\nP1\n150\n\n\nS2\nP3\n300\n\n\nS3\nP2\n250\n\n\n\nIn these normalized tables, each tuple is essential and there is no redundancy. The SupplierName is not repeated for each shipment from the same supplier, and similarly, the PartName is not repeated for each shipment of the same part. This design adheres to the principles of ETNF, enhancing data integrity and consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedundancy Reduction: ETNF effectively reduces data redundancy by ensuring that all data stored in the database is essential and non-repetitive.\nData Integrity and Consistency: By minimizing redundancy, ETNF enhances the integrity and consistency of the database, making data more reliable and accurate.\nBalanced Complexity: ETNF offers a middle ground between 4NF and 5NF, reducing redundancy without the complexity of decomposing relations into smaller, more numerous relations as often required by 5NF.\n\n\n\n\n\nDependency Analysis: The first step involves a detailed analysis of all functional and join dependencies across the database to identify redundancy and determine the scope for normalization to ETNF.\nSchema Evaluation and Restructuring: Evaluate existing database schemas against ETNF criteria, identifying areas where restructuring is required to eliminate redundancy and enhance efficiency.\nPractical Application and Migration: Implement the ETNF principles through schema redesign and careful data migration, ensuring that the transition does not impact data integrity or system availability."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: rejected\nDeciders: V-Sekai, fire, antpb\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nThe VRM format is becoming increasingly popular in the field of 3D modeling and animation. It allows for easy sharing and transfer of humanoid 3D models with skeletal animations between different software applications. One such application is the Godot Engine, a popular open-source game engine.\n\n\n\nCurrently, developers working with VRM files in Godot Engine face difficulties when trying to convert these files to Blender format for further editing or manipulation. Manual conversion processes can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n\n\nThe proposed strategy for enabling VRM to Blender conversion involves leveraging the computational power of cloud GPUs provided by replicate.com.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAYON is an open-source pipeline platform designed for creative studios, particularly those involved in animation and visual effects (VFX). It provides a robust and scalable solution for managing and executing creative projects. AYON’s source code is publicly accessible, allowing for community-driven development and customization. It is geared towards creative studios, particularly those working in animation and VFX. Evolved from OpenPype, it has been used since 2018 in various production environments. Supported and funded by the creative industry, AYON also offers comprehensive documentation for users, including guides for administrators and developers.\n\n\n\nHosted cloud services provide a flexible and scalable infrastructure solution that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an organization. They offer a range of services including compute power, storage, and networking capabilities, as well as advanced services such as machine learning and data analytics. These services are typically provided on a pay-as-you-go basis, making them a cost-effective option for many organizations.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate AYON on hosted cloud services for a game development studio.\n\n\n\nDeploy AYON using a single Docker image with hosted cloud services for Redis and PostgreSQL.\n\n\nRun a release of https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/releases on Windows 11 desktop.\n\n\n\nWhy does OpenPype use mongodb?\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will configure AYON according to the needs of a typical game development studio.

However, there are certain limitations that hinder the overall user experience. This proposal aims to address these limitations by proposing specific areas for improvement within V-Sekai.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai currently faces several limitations, including non-functional menus in VR mode and a limited number of available worlds. These challenges affect the usability and variety of experiences for the users. To overcome these challenges and enhance the V-Sekai user experience, we must prioritize and focus on one area for improvement.\n\n\nWe propose focusing on Generating More Worlds as the first step towards enhancing V-Sekai. By creating new VR worlds within V-Sekai, users will have a wider range of experiences to explore. This involves designing and implementing new environments to expand the options available. With more worlds to choose from, users will have increased engagement and longer sessions within the V-Sekai platform.\n\n\n\n\nTo generate more worlds for V-Sekai, we will follow a comprehensive strategy that includes the following steps:\n\nIdentify User Preferences: Understand the target audience and their preferences. Research popular VR themes, genres, and settings to get an idea of what users would enjoy.\nDesign New Environments: Use 3D modeling software like Blender or Unity to design new virtual environments for V-Sekai. Consider creating diverse worlds like fantasy realms, futuristic cities, natural landscapes, or historical settings.\nImplement Interactive Elements: Make the new worlds interactive by adding objects, characters, and elements that users can engage with. This can include non-playable characters (NPCs), puzzles, hidden items, or mini-games within each world.\nTest and Refine: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the new worlds are visually appealing, optimized for performance, and provide a seamless VR experience. Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements based on their suggestions.\nIntegrate with V-Sekai: Once the new worlds are ready, integrate them into the V-Sekai platform. Ensure they are easily accessible through the menus or navigation system within V-Sekai’s VR interface.\nRelease and Promote: Launch the updated version of V-Sekai with the newly generated worlds. Promote the release through various channels, such as social media, gaming forums, Virtual Reality communities, and V-Sekai’s official website.\n\nBy following this strategy, we will not only address the current limitations but also create an engaging and immersive VR experience for V-Sekai users.\n\n\n\n\nIncreased user engagement: The availability of more worlds will provide users with greater options to explore, leading to longer sessions and increased immersion in V-Sekai.\nExpanded user base: With a wider range of experiences, V-Sekai will attract new users who are looking for diverse VR environments.\nPositive word-of-mouth: Satisfied users will share their experiences with others, generating positive reviews and recommendations for V-Sekai.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment complexity: Creating new worlds requires significant effort and resources, including 3D modeling, programming, and testing. This may lead to increased development time and costs.\nUpfront investment: Generating more worlds will require upfront investment in terms of design, implementation, and integration with V-Sekai.\nUser feedback and iteration: Continuous user feedback is crucial to refine and improve the new worlds. This iterative process may extend the development timeline.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative solution that was considered was Integrating Backend Services. This would involve improving the backend infrastructure of V-Sekai to enhance scalability, performance, and reliability. However, after careful consideration, we prioritize generating more worlds as it directly addresses user experience limitations and provides tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and appeal.\n\n\n\nThe generation of more worlds is within the core capabilities of our team at V-Sekai. We have experienced 3D designers, developers, and testers who are skilled in creating immersive VR environments. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to execute this proposed solution effectively and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nThis article is assisted by AI.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need clarification on any aspect of this proposal, please feel free to ask."

    "title": "Proposed VRM mtoon in Substance Designer",
    "section": "",
    "text": "VRM is a file format for handling 3D humanoid avatars in VR applications. It’s designed to be a versatile and exchangeable format across various systems. mtoon is a toon shader used with VRM models to give them a distinct, stylized look that emulates 2D animation within a 3D space.\nSubstance Designer is a powerful node-based texturing tool essential for creating realistic textures for 3D models. By implementing mtoon support in Substance Designer, we can bridge the gap between high-quality texture design and VRM character customization.\n\n\n\nThe current workflow for applying toon shading to VRM models is disconnected from the process of designing textures, often requiring multiple tools and manual adjustments.

It’s designed to be a versatile and exchangeable format across various systems. mtoon is a toon shader used with VRM models to give them a distinct, stylized look that emulates 2D animation within a 3D space.\nSubstance Designer is a powerful node-based texturing tool essential for creating realistic textures for 3D models. By implementing mtoon support in Substance Designer, we can bridge the gap between high-quality texture design and VRM character customization."

We are considering using the Axolotl library in a mode that batches the inputs.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to effectively use these samples to fine-tune the model for each task without overfitting, while also ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation: First, we need to prepare our data for each task. This involves cleaning the data and splitting it into training and validation sets.\nModel Selection: Next, we select the latest models that we want to fine-tune. These could be models from Hugging Face’s model hub or any other source.\nFine-tuning with Axolotl: We will use the Axolotl library for fine-tuning. We can batch-mask our inputs to efficiently utilize our computational resources. This process will be repeated for each task.\nEvaluation: After fine-tuning, we evaluate the model on our validation set for each task to see how well it performs.\n\n\n\n\nBy fine-tuning the latest models on our specific tasks, we can potentially achieve better performance than using pre-trained models out-of-the-box. Also, Axolotl provides an easy-to-use interface for fine-tuning models.\n\n\n\nFine-tuning models requires computational resources and time. Also, with only 100 samples per task, there’s a risk of overfitting.\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach could be to use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of our dataset before fine-tuning.\n\n\n\nIf we have tasks that are infrequently performed, it might not be worth the effort to fine-tune a model specifically for these tasks.\n\n\n\nYes, this strategy involves us actively participating in the fine-tuning process.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai\nAxolotl\nAI assists this article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nIn the world of graph-based machine learning, the GraphSAGE algorithm has emerged as a powerful tool for generating node embeddings. It’s an inductive method that learns to generate embeddings by leveraging node feature information and the graph structure.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the GraphSAGE algorithm can be challenging due to its complex nature and the use of various mathematical concepts. This proposal aims to break down the algorithm into understandable components and explain how it works in a clear and concise manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm incrementally aggregates and updates the representations of each node by considering the information from its local neighbors at each depth.\nAs the depth K increases, nodes incorporate information from a wider neighborhood.\nThe choice of aggregator functions can vary and has a significant impact on the performance and the type of information aggregated.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph G(V,E)G(V,E): The input graph with nodes VV and edges EE.\nInput Features {xv∀v∈V}{xv​∀v∈V}: The features for each node in the graph.\nDepth KK: The depth of the search or the number of iterations.\nWeight Matrices Wk∀k∈{1…K}Wk​∀k∈{1…K}: The weight matrices used for each depth kk.\nNon-linearity σσ: A non-linear activation function.\nAggregator Functions AGGREGATEk∀k∈{1…K}AGGREGATEk​∀k∈{1…K}: Functions that aggregate information from the node’s neighbors.\nNeighborhood Function NN: A function that returns the set of neighbors for a given node.\n\n\n\n\n\nVector Representations zv∀v∈Vzv​∀v∈V: The resulting vector representations for all nodes in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialization: Each node’s feature vector xvxv​ is used as the initial representation hv0hv0​.\nIteration for Depth KK: For each depth level from 1 to KK:\n\nFor each node vv in the graph:\n\nAggregate the representations of the nodes in its neighborhood N(v)N(v) using the aggregator function AGGREGATEkAGGREGATEk​ for that depth. This results in a new vector hN(v)khN(v)k​.\nConcatenate this aggregated vector with the node’s current representation hvk−1hvk−1​, and apply the weight matrix WkWk​ followed by the non-linearity σσ. This results in the updated representation hvkhvk​.\nNormalize the updated representation.\n\n\nFinal Representations: After the final iteration KK, the output for each node vv, zvzv​, is set as its last representation hvKhvK​.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm incrementally aggregates and updates the representations of each node by considering the information from its local neighbors at each depth.\nAs the depth KK increases, nodes incorporate information from a wider neighborhood.\nThe choice of aggregator functions can vary and has a significant impact on the performance and the type of information aggregated.\n\n\n\n\n\nInductive Learning: Unlike traditional methods that require retraining for new nodes, this algorithm can generate embeddings for unseen nodes.\nFlexibility: The algorithm can be adapted to different types of graphs and feature sets.\nScalability: It’s designed to work efficiently on large graphs.\n\nUnderstanding this algorithm helps in applying it to real-world graph problems, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and more, where the structure and features of the graph can be leveraged to learn informative node embeddings.\n\n\n\n\nThe GraphSAGE algorithm provides a flexible and scalable solution for generating node embeddings in large graphs. It allows for inductive learning, which means it can handle unseen nodes without requiring retraining. This makes it particularly useful for dynamic graphs where nodes may be added or removed over time.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm’s performance heavily depends on the choice of aggregator functions and the quality of node features. Poorly chosen functions or low-quality features can lead to suboptimal embeddings. Additionally, the algorithm may not perform well on graphs with complex structures or those that lack sufficient node feature information.\n\n\n\nAlternative methods for generating node embeddings, such as transductive learning algorithms, could be considered. However, these methods typically require retraining when new nodes are added, making them less suitable for dynamic graphs.\n\n\n\nWhile GraphSAGE is highly effective for many graph-based machine learning tasks, it may not be the best choice for all scenarios. For instance, in cases where the graph structure is less important than node features, other methods like feature-based machine learning models might be more appropriate.\n\n\n\nYes, this explanation of the GraphSAGE algorithm has been developed by us, with assistance from AI assistant Aria.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai · GitHub - Official GitHub account for the V-Sekai development community focusing on social VR functionality for the Godot Engine\nV-Sekai/v-sekai-game - GitHub page for the V-Sekai open-source project bringing social VR/VRSNS/metaverse components to the Godot Engine\nInductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs"

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this.

So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this. Copy the first two numbers from the CockroachDB CCL line. In this case, 20.2\n#\n# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.\n# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.\n# To exit, type: \\q.\n#\n# Server version: CockroachDB CCL v20.2.2 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nReplace some.version in the following command with the value we found above:\nSET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.preserve_downgrade_option = 'some.version';\nFinally, perform the upgrade:\nsudo kubectl delete job cockroachdb-init\nsudo helm upgrade cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl delete pods/cockroachdb-client-secure\nsudo kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml"

    "title": "Accepted: Adding Entity Networking to Groups",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: accepted\nDeciders: V-Sekai,Lyuma,SaracenOne\n\n\n\nFor Groups, this system aims to solve the following issues:\n\n(A) Need a way to standardize scene spawning.\n(B) Need a way to refer to nodes/instances that is consistent across clients (for example, “Set parent to …”).\n(C) Need a way to synchronize state between clients.\n(D) Provides a basic set of standard protocols and interactions.\n(E) Provides the basis for a security/privacy model regarding entity communication/permissions over the network.\n(F) Provides a security model locally for access between nodes of one entity and nodes of another entity (assuming a secure scripting framework is implemented).\n(G) This also solves the problem of abstracting away implementation details of entities; for example, there should be no need to deal with Godot nodes on an individual basis.\n(H) Provide a unified way to create top-level physics hierarchies isolated from other game logic.\n\nNote: This proposal covers three Spawn Types:\n\nSpawn type (i) Entities integrated into a map;\nSpawn type (ii) map entities spawned by clients; and\nSpawn type (iii) avatar entities/props spawned by clients.)\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n\n\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibility of:\n\nvehicle games\nbow and arrow games\npickup of balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\n\n\nA networking system is not a few lines of code.\n\n\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n\n\nAldridge, David. “I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach”.

    "text": "As indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network."

    "text": "Todo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity."

    "text": "Thunderbolt Driver Issue Solution\nTo all who end up in this thread, as I did. Welcome\nAnother user in this thread had a solution that worked for me, so I will repeat it with a more detailed explanation.\nCredit to “Johnatan” on page 3\nThe issue is that the new Thunderbolt drivers fail to remove and overwrite the old drivers. The problem can be resolved through the device manager.\nRight-click on “Start” (the Windows icon at the corner of your taskbar) and select “Device Manager.”\nWithin the device manager, open the category “System Devices.”\nScroll down to Thunderbolt(TM) Controller - (model number here)\n*Right-click on it, select “Uninstall Device,” and check the box “Delete the driver software for this device.”\nOnce removed, rerun the Thunderbolt installer or the update through the Dell Command Updater.\n*If you are worried about uninstalling the driver in the device manager, fret not. The driver will reinstall itself on reboot if you have an internet connection."

    "text": "Proposed: Soiree party mode\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nV-Sekai aspires to be an open source 3d virtual world platform that has VR and desktop modes.\nWe want to make it easy to deploy V-Sekai in Soiree mode.\n\n\nDescribe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nWe package V-Sekai in Soiree Party mode, so it is easier to test the system.\nA Soiree is a party or gathering, typically in a private house, for conversation or music.\n\nRisks\nSandstorm network access APIs may not work for the use case.\nIn most cases, things that run over plain HTTP requests should be able to work, but other network protocols tend to be nontrivial.\nSandstorm at current would neither support WebRTC or UDP traffic through the Powerbox, but it is uncertain what is needed to add it.\nRisk to migrate the Sandstorm ecosystem to Kubernetes helm system to match the devops status quo. Vargrant is not the status quo.\n\nProxying\nSome udp based proxying methods are known\n\nhttps://github.com/yyyar/gobetween for standalone\ncillium for kubernetes\nWebRTC ice, stun, turn\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nV-Sekai Developers\nWe package V-Sekai in Soiree party mode.\n\nWe start a single server of CockroachDB SQL database and not the default 3 server mode.\nWe provide installs of the Godot game engine client and server.\nWe re-arrange our elixir application Uro to work as a Sandstorm.io application.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai Packages\n\nV-Sekai provides a Server Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Client Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Uro Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\n\nThere is an open question if V-Sekai sandbox design works with powerbox.\n\n\nPlayer and Hosts\n\nIndividual hosts of Sandstorm.io can start their own grains of V-Sekai in Soiree mode.\nPlayers download the Godot Engine client and play.\n\n\n\nHosts\n\nMust provide a way to access the Godot Engine server and the Sandstorm server.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt is not trivial and not a few lines to implement a distributed system for a developer.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nSelf-hosted is a feature.\nWe can use Soiree Party mode to test V-Sekai.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nMaybe too complicated for the developers.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe are investigating how to implement the Soiree Party mode.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.cockroachlabs.com/\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/powerbox/\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/services/\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm\nhttps://github.com/mrmetaverse/soiree\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The chief engineer’s prestige reinforces the importance of expertise while it also balances out the functional bent of the other engineers. The chief engineer also promotes mutual adjustment by providing the working instructions for each vehicle program and by resolving cross-functional disagreements.\nThe second mechanism is cross-functional communication.

This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.\nWhen switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one–you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.\nYou click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nAble to mask loading times\nAble to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai\nFor style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\ncoordinating cats\nThe drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.\nIt makes for a far less friction-less experience\nBut again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional\nWe could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn’t happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWorld traversal is a problem.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018-present SaracenOne\nCopyright (c) 2019-present K.

This is ideal for quick data manipulation and caching.\nRaft/Ra for Distributed Consensus: Raft/Ra will be deployed to ensure distributed consensus across system nodes, which is crucial for coordinated state changes and maintaining data consistency.\nCockroachDB for Persistent Storage: CockroachDB will store critical, structured data that requires ACID transactions and global accessibility. This ensures the durability of our data.\nData Flow Management: Protocols will be established to move temporary data from Etso/ETS to the CDN for bulk storage. For structured data persistence, we will use CockroachDB.\nConsistency Management: Raft/Ra will manage write operations across the CDN and CockroachDB to ensure consistency and fault tolerance.\n\n\n\ndefmodule MyApp.Cache do\n  use Etso.Schema\n  @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}\n  field :key, :string\n  field :value, :any\nend\n\n\n\nRaft/Ra will be implemented to ensure distributed consensus across system nodes.\n\n\n\nCockroachDB will store critical, structured data that requires ACID transactions and global accessibility.\n\n\n\nThe Membrane Framework will establish Data flow protocols to move temporary data from Etso/ETS to the CDN for bulk storage and CockroachDB for structured data persistence.\n\n\n\nRaft/Ra will manage write operations across the CDN and CockroachDB, ensuring consistency and fault tolerance."

Procedural generation is an algorithmic method of content creation that replaces manual design, resulting in a larger array of unique combinations.\nThe procedural generator can be developed using a mix of algorithms, libraries, and assets to produce a vast assortment of variations for props, environments, and avatars. Users’ input parameters, such as prop type, color, size, and material, will guide the generator in crafting distinctive content.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph TD\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; B(Select Base Model)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; C(Apply Procedural Variations)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; D(Combine Variations)\n  B --&gt; E(Base Model)\n  C --&gt; F(Shape Variation)\n  C --&gt; G(Color Variation)\n  C --&gt; H(Texture Variation)\n  F --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  G --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  H --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  E --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  I --&gt; J(Final Output)\nThis flowchart demonstrates the procedural generation process using the following steps:\n\nUser Input Parameters: Users provide their preferences for prop type, color, size, and material.\nSelect Base Model: The generator selects a base model corresponding to the chosen prop type.\nApply Procedural Variations: The generator applies algorithmic variations to the base model, modifying its shape, color, and texture based on user input.\nCombine Variations: The generator combines these variations to create a unique prop with the specified properties.\nGenerate Unique Prop, Environment, or Avatar: The final output is a unique prop, environment, or avatar that meets the user’s preferences.\n\nThis approach increases the variety and customization options in V-Sekai, enhancing the platform’s appeal and offering a more engaging experience for users.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEnhanced variety: Procedural generation enables a wide array of unique content, delivering a diverse and constantly evolving experience for users.\nUser personalization: By incorporating user preferences, the generator can produce content that aligns with individual tastes and needs.\nEfficient resource utilization: Procedural content generation minimizes the need for manual design and asset creation, leading to a more cost-effective platform.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nComplexity: Developing a procedural generator can be intricate, necessitating expertise in algorithms, 3D modeling, and other technical domains.\nPerformance impact: Real-time content generation might affect performance, particularly if algorithms are not optimized or if the platform experiences high user traffic.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDo nothing.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is a few lines of code.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe care about v-sekai more than others.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

To boost its functionality and compatibility with other tools, we propose integrating networked procedural generation as a sidecar to the Godot engine server, allowing for more dynamic and immersive environments in V-Sekai.\nTo further address V-Sekai’s limitations, we suggest incorporating the Membrane Framework along with other relevant technologies such as Godot Engine, OpenMfx Support, Elixir Phoenix, and Elixir Nx. This comprehensive integration will not only enhance V-Sekai’s capabilities but also increase its versatility across various use cases.\nThe implementation involves connecting V-Sekai with the components mentioned in the Membrane Framework diagram below:\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant MembraneFramework\n  participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  participant ElixirNx\n  participant AIMLFramework\n  participant Yugabyte\n\n  rect rgb(240, 248, 255)\n    note over MembraneFramework, Yugabyte: Toggle Actions\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient: TOGGLE_GAME_ENGINE_AND_CLIENTS\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;ElixirNx: ACCELERATE_MEMBRANE_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;AIMLFramework: TOGGLE_AIML_FRAMEWORK\n    MembraneFramework-&gt;&gt;Yugabyte: TOGGLE_YUGABYTE\n  end\n\n  box \"Source\" #CCFFCC\n    participant MembraneFramework\n    participant WebAndGodotEngineAndBlenderClient\n  end\n\n  box \"Filter\" #FFFFCC\n    participant ElixirNx\n    participant AIMLFramework\n  end\n\n  box \"Sink & Source of Data\" #FFCCCC\n    participant Yugabyte\n  end\n\n\nWe propose using read replicas for applications needing single-zone writes and multi-region reads. Benefits include:\n\nResilience: Zone-level resilience with primary cluster nodes across multiple zones.\nConsistency: Timeline consistency in replica clusters, better than eventual consistency.\nLatency: Quick reads from primary and replica clusters; write latency depends on client-primary cluster distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved functionality and versatility of V-Sekai\nEnhanced compatibility with other tools and platforms\nGreater potential for collaboration and community involvement\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased complexity in implementation and maintenance\nPotential performance overhead due to integration of multiple components\n\n\n\n\n\nStandalone procedural generation: Implementing procedural generation as a standalone feature without integrating it with the Godot Engine server. This option was discarded because it would not provide the same level of compatibility and versatility as the proposed solution.\nUsing pre-built assets: Relying on pre-built assets for creating environments instead of implementing networked procedural generation. This option was discarded due to the limited flexibility and potential for repetitive content, which could negatively impact user engagement.\nThird-party procedural generation tools: Integrating third-party procedural generation tools instead of developing a custom solution. This option was discarded because it may not offer the same level of control and customization required for V-Sekai’s specific needs.\nStatic environment design: Focusing on static environment design rather than dynamic, procedurally generated content.

How can we improve the collaboration process and attract more contributors to work on the project more effectively?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option to overcome the limitation of attracting more contributors and improving collaboration is to develop clear and concise project documentation, including a visual roadmap using mermaid.js, and establish a transparent contribution process. This will provide a structured environment for new and existing contributors to collaborate and understand the project’s goals and priorities.\n\nHow it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nA well-organized project documentation and visual roadmap will help potential contributors understand the project’s scope and vision, allowing them to make informed decisions about contributing.\nA transparent contribution process will facilitate collaboration by providing guidelines, resources, and communication channels for contributors.\nOnboarding new contributors with tutorials and mentorship will help them quickly become productive and dedicated team members.\nRegular meetings and progress updates will keep the team motivated and focused on achieving milestones.\nRecognizing and rewarding contributors will foster a sense of community and commitment, making it more likely that they continue contributing to the project.\n\nWith these measures in place, the V-Sekai project will overcome its current limitations, making it easier for the team to work together and attract new contributors.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nDevelop a clear and concise project documentation that outlines the project’s goals, requirements, and milestones. Establish a transparent and structured contribution process, including:\n\nCreate a centralized repository for documentation, code, and assets, with clear guidelines for contributing.\nDevelop a project roadmap with prioritized tasks, deadlines, and assigned responsibilities.\nImplement an onboarding process for new contributors, including tutorials, resources, and mentorship.\nOrganize regular meetings and communication channels for updates, progress reports, and collaboration.\nRecognize and reward contributors for their work, fostering a sense of community and commitment.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nImproved collaboration and communication among the team\nAttracting more contributors with diverse skill sets\nFaster progress towards project milestones\nClear understanding of project goals and priorities\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nIncreased management and coordination overhead\nPotential for disagreements on priorities and approaches\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nRelying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\nContinuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nWhile it may be possible to work around some aspects of the problem with a few lines of script, it would not address the underlying issues of attracting and retaining contributors or improving collaboration. The proposed solution aims to create a more sustainable and efficient environment for the V-Sekai project, which cannot be achieved with a temporary workaround or a simple script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nAs the primary developers of the project, the V-Sekai team has the best understanding of the project’s goals, objectives, and priorities. Implementing this feature in-house will ensure that the solution aligns well with the project’s vision and addresses the specific needs of the project.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nV-Sekai Roadmap and Goals\nV-Sekai Team Discussions and Updates\nMermaid.js"

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, ellenhp, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, ai assisted\n\n\n\n\nThe problem of simulating audio reverb in Godot Engine 4 involves accurately modeling the way sound waves propagate, reflect, and interact within a given environment. This requires sampling a chaotic 7-dimensional space every frame, either through precomputation or real-time processing. The complexity arises from the fact that sound behaves more like light with intense diffraction, making it impossible to rasterize.\n\n\n\nImplement Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs) for artificial reverberation. FDNs consist of multiple delay lines connected in a feedback loop with a mixing matrix. The output is a combination of the input signal and the delayed signals.\n\n\n\nChoose the number of delay lines and their lengths based on the desired reverberation time and room characteristics.\nImplement a mixing matrix to control the energy distribution between the delay lines.\nCreate a feedback loop by connecting the outputs of the delay lines to the inputs through the mixing matrix.\nCombine the input signal with the delayed signals to produce the reverberated output.\n\n\n\n\n\nclass_name FDN\nextends Node\n\nvar num_delay_lines : int\nvar delay_lines : Array\nvar mixing_matrix : Array\nvar room_characteristics : Dictionary\n\nfunc _init(num_delay_lines: int, delay_lengths: Array, mixing_matrix: Array, room_characteristics: Dictionary):\n    self.num_delay_lines = num_delay_lines\n    self.delay_lines = []\n    for length in delay_lengths:\n        self.delay_lines.append(DelayLine.new(length))\n    self.mixing_matrix = mixing_matrix\n    self.room_characteristics = room_characteristics\n\nfunc process(input_signal: float) -&gt; float:\n    # Step 1: Calculate the output of each delay line\n    var delay_outputs = []\n    for dl in self.delay_lines:\n        delay_outputs.append(dl.process(input_signal))\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the room characteristics to the delay line outputs\n    var processed_outputs = apply_room_characteristics(delay_outputs)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the mixing matrix to the processed delay line outputs\n    var mixed_outputs = apply_mixing_matrix(processed_outputs)\n\n    # Step 4: Update the delay lines with the mixed outputs\n    for i in range(self.num_delay_lines):\n        self.delay_lines[i].update(mixed_outputs[i])\n\n    # Step 5: Combine the input signal with the delayed signals\n    var output_signal = input_signal + sum(mixed_outputs)\n    return output_signal\n\nfunc apply_room_characteristics(delay_outputs: Array) -&gt; Array:\n    var processed_outputs = []\n    for i in range(len(delay_outputs)):\n        processed_output = delay_outputs[i] * room_characteristics[\"absorption\"][i]\n        processed_outputs.append(processed_output)\n    return processed_outputs\n\nfunc apply_mixing_matrix(delay_outputs: Array) -&gt; Array:\n    # TODO: Implement the mixing matrix application logic\n    pass\n\n\n\n\nImproved audio reverb simulation\nMore realistic sound propagation and interaction within environments\nSmarter estimation of long reverb times\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased computational complexity\nPotential performance impact on real-time processing\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dijkstra Pathfinding\nDWN (Digital Waveguide Network): A method for simulating audio reverb by modeling sound propagation as waves traveling along waveguides with bidirectional delay lines and scattering junctions.\nRay tracing can be used to simulate sound propagation in 3D environments. It involves casting rays from the sound source and tracing their paths as they interact with the environment (reflect, refract, and diffract). By calculating the time delay and attenuation of each ray reaching the listener, you can generate an impulse response that represents the acoustic properties of the space.\nConvolution reverb is a technique that uses recorded impulse responses (IRs) of real spaces or digital simulations to recreate the reverberation characteristics of those spaces. The process involves convolving the dry audio signal with the impulse response to produce the reverberated audio.\n\n\n\n\nNo, implementing FDNs requires a more complex algorithm and cannot be achieved with just a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nYes, as it directly impacts the audio experience within V-Sekai environments, it should be a core feature to ensure consistent and high-quality audio reverb simulation.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai: A virtual reality platform that allows users to create and explore immersive environments.\nGodot Engine 4: An open-source game engine used for creating 2D and 3D games and interactive applications.\nAudio Reverb: The persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound has stopped, caused by reflections off surfaces within the environment.\nFeedback Delay Networks (FDNs): A method for simulating artificial reverberation using multiple delay lines connected in a feedback loop with a mixing matrix.\nDelay Line: A digital signal processing technique that introduces a time delay to an input signal, often used in audio effects such as reverb and echo.\nMixing Matrix: A mathematical construct used to control the energy distribution between the delay lines in an FDN.\nRoom Characteristics: Acoustic properties of a room or environment, such as absorption, reflection, and diffusion, which affect how sound propagates within the space.\nReverberation Time: The time it takes for the sound level in a room to decrease by 60 decibels after the sound source has stopped.\nDigital Waveguide Network (DWN): An alternative method for simulating audio reverb by modeling sound propagation as waves traveling along waveguides with bidirectional delay lines and scattering junctions.\nRay Tracing: A technique used to simulate sound propagation in 3D environments by casting rays from the sound source and tracing their paths as they interact with the environment (reflect, refract, and diffract).\nConvolution Reverb: A technique that uses recorded impulse responses (IRs) of real spaces or digital simulations to recreate the reverberation characteristics of those spaces by convolving the dry audio signal with the impulse response.\nImpulse Response (IR): A recording or simulation of the acoustic properties of a space, used in convolution reverb to recreate the reverberation characteristics of that space.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s consider an example of implementing a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) for audio reverb simulation with 8 delay lines. We will analyze the computational and I/O complexity involved in this specific case.\n\n\n\nFor a medium-quality reverb effect, let’s consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN.\nFor an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware.\n\n\n\n\nFor a medium-quality reverb effect, let’s consider using 8 delay lines in the FDN. The main components contributing to the computational complexity are:\n\nDelay Lines: Each delay line requires memory for storing the delayed samples and computations for updating the delay buffer. For 8 delay lines, the complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nMatrix Mixing: The mixing matrix combines the outputs of the delay lines in a specific way to create the desired reverb effect. For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\nFeedback and Input/Output Processing: Additional processing, such as filtering or gain adjustments, may be applied to the input, output, or feedback paths. This complexity depends on the specific filters or processing used but is generally proportional to the number of delay lines.\n\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\n\n\n\nThe I/O complexity refers to the amount of data that needs to be read from and written to memory during the processing of the reverb effect. In the case of an FDN with 8 delay lines, the I/O complexity is mainly determined by:\n\nReading and Writing Delay Line Buffers: Each delay line requires reading and writing operations for updating the delay buffer. The I/O complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nInput and Output Audio Data: The audio input data must be read, processed, and combined with the output of the FDN to generate the final reverberated audio signal. The I/O complexity for input and output audio data is generally low compared to the delay line buffer operations.\n\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware."

You will need Elixir installed.\nI recommend getting the latest, but for these steps, I am using Elixir v1.13.3.\nDownload Uro from https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro\nWe are using the dev environment. It is the default, but you can also set MIX_ENV=dev.\nTo compile HTML/CSS webpack:\ncd assets\nnpm install\nnpm run deploy\ncd ..\nIf the compile gives issues, you can run it multiple times. To compile dependencies:\nmix do compile, phx.digest\nIf one of them gives an error due to nmake or not having a compiler, you can fix it by opening a x64 Native Tools command prompt from visual studio and run mix deps.compile bcrypt_elixir\nFinally, create and migrate the database and start the development server:\nmix ecto.create\nmix ecto.migrate\nmix phx.server\nThis will start uro at http://localhost:4000/\nGitHub - V-Sekai/uro: Server backend for V-Sekai written in Elixir …\nThe docker image docker-uro is compiled using GoCD, so after pushing, check that the pipeline ran.\nThen, go to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/groupsinfra/uro/tags and check the most recently pushed tag (it will not be the latest one, but instead a specific version).\nNow, edit the flux config at https://github.com/V-Sekai/flux-config/blob/flux2/workloads/uro-deployment.yaml and replace the uro image version with the tag from above.\nCheck that uro-deployment was updated.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe’re able to update uro!\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nOption graveyard\nNo response\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt’s arguably a few lines of script, but it’s our script!\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe maintain the website.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nUro\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro/issues/52\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

There’s also a microsoft and a mozilla hub implementation for spatial audio node in wav?, mp3? or ogg? . He had unfinished business with the extension namespace of hubs and wanted to split it.\n2021-06-23 00:19:33Z lyuma: “https://github.com/V-Sekai-godot-hop-spin-dance Don’t get your hopes up quite yet: A lot of the lower level dependencies for scene packing and t-posing are not converted yet, but the tool scripts work now, so it’s a start :-p” 🔥 (1)\n2021-06-23 00:19:07Z lyuma: Worked with fire to get the avatar conversion tool updated, using the high level vsk_avatar vsk_vrm_avatar_tool modules: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/857052116593803284/unknown.png\n2021-06-22 23:48:06Z lyuma: mux says they also keep hitting this issue. they also made the connection to set_name() interestingly\n2021-06-22 23:47:51Z lyuma: after a day of debuggin, Saracen got a reproduction project here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/49843\n2021-06-22 23:22:17Z fire: Another day. Implement vrm quaternion format from lox9973 from ShaderMotion to move godot VRMs\n2021-06-22 21:00:23Z fire: We ported the avatar T-Poser to the point the menu popup shows and checkpointed, then concluded for lunch. Multiple modules were ported.\n2021-06-22 20:56:35Z fire: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/2903 Lyuma wrote a proposal\n2021-06-22 17:33:46Z fire: “Did a 5 minute design for libcurl in Godot Engine.

Also making more bug reports for serious issues I encounter 🐛 (1),👍 (1)\n2021-06-20 20:29:37Z fire: It’s pretty slow like 7 seconds\n2021-06-20 20:29:23Z fire: &gt; RGBA Max error: 77 RMSE: 1.55 PSNR 44.34 dB\n2021-06-20 20:29:22Z fire: # bc7_enc_rdo\n2021-06-20 20:29:01Z Saracen: Wow, the existing one is already pretty fast.

It was a badly ported coroutine calling a heavy function continually. Still some issues with pathfinding and abilities not executing, but it’s at least actually functioning now.\n2021-06-19 19:22:18Z Saracen: Further fixes, there’s workarounds now for the tool I wrote to extract root motion. Two of the notable bugs I’ve discovered are ConfigFile.load returning random values and the fact that there doesn’t seem to be implicit casting between String and StringName. Want to create some example projects for this. It’s also worth noting that while Amethyst is close to being functional now, it’s running OBSCENELY slow at the moment. 🦥 (1)\n2021-06-19 18:01:49Z Saracen: Some more progress on the Amethyst port\n2021-06-19 07:45:39Z fire: Can now export blends to gltf2 and save as an artifact.

It’s amazing how many different ways there are to fix bit operations on a single line of code\n2021-06-11 03:45:26Z lyuma: Updated shader_improvements_meta_3.x branch for latest 3.x godot so someone could try SCSS (I want to keep it for historical purposes). I’m not going to update 4.x because it’s in flux and too much churn with renames to keep anything working\n2021-06-11 03:44:54Z lyuma: Found a bug in MToon, related to a line of code that flips the normal if it’s pointing backwards from the view direction (you can see this if you look at an MToon face with custom normals from a sharp direction).\n2021-06-10 22:56:30Z fire: Restoring the CICD builds for godot 4.

I can now start a github action, start a kubernetes server, start a argo server, start an alpine linux image, have a whale message a hello world and then save it as a file and have it be download as a github artifact\n2021-06-09 20:50:29Z lyuma: “I tried baking lighting in the”“AirBNB”” and ran into this error: &gt; WARNING: Inconsistency found in triangulation while building BSP, probe interpolation quality may degrade a bit. &gt; at: LightmapGI::_compute_bsp_tree (scene\\3d_gi.cpp:460) &gt; &gt; Jfons informed me it is an issue with separating tetrahedrons.

There were bugs reading the scale, but now that is fixed and the issue with losing polygons will only happen on triangles with 1e-7 edge length in world space.\n\nThe issue with removing mesh edges still exists, in theory, but in practice it seems unlikely so let’s wait and see if it shows up in the wild and then we can take another look”\n\n2021-06-09 18:09:18Z lyuma: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/852248004215570432/unknown.png\n2021-06-09 18:07:18Z lyuma: Due to a glitch in Godot’s etcpak implementation, I had to use BPTC texture compression.

I think we’re going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.\n\nRadical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.\nAdd BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.\nMeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints? The glb here should have a spinning diamond and two spinning skinned cubes:” https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/845433592888557568/MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3.glb\n\n2021-05-21 22:29:43Z fire: We also gain the ability to post more twitter tweets.\n2021-05-21 22:29:23Z fire: Had a discussion with Lyuma and Saracen about V-Sekai for wider testing and how it was blocked by scene validation feature.\n2021-05-21 15:27:33Z fire: Multiple PRs from fire and Lyuma were merged for gltf problems\n2021-05-20 15:28:19Z fire: トカゲ https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-fire/commits/features/skeleton-gizmos I did some cleanup, rebased on the modification stack and changed the color for selected bones to be a darker orange\n2021-05-20 15:26:43Z fire: Lyuma IK and Modification stack are now a stacked branch.\n2021-05-20 04:21:06Z fire: Work with Lyuma on 3 glTF bug fixes. 1. instead of failing all the meshes only fail once 2. the skins duplication removal code has a bug and it needs to check skin bind bone, skin bind name and pose transform. 3. the skin bind code was removed 4. gltf 4.0 modules was backported to 3.2\n2021-05-19 19:20:41Z fire: Lyuma and I summarized our concerns about the ease of implementation and the inability to use off the shelf code.\n2021-05-19 19:20:00Z fire: OMI Week 3.

It’s really exciting to get this much imported with just a couple clicks and about 30 seconds of waiting\n2021-05-13 21:37:01Z lyuma: it’s a bit of random chance that it looks so similar: the skydome and some objects like flowers have completely custom shaders, so those will have to be ported manually\n2021-05-13 21:36:32Z Saracen: This is actually starting to look like the original now\n2021-05-13 21:36:27Z Saracen: Woah!\n2021-05-13 21:36:04Z lyuma: Unidot Importer: Got lighting and basic environment settings importing.

Make sure resources have been imported by opening the project in the editor at least once.\nNote that I was forced to rebase to the latest build which includes the new build system (target=editor) most of the code I changed is in the private gitlab repo. once things stabilize and we get the build system up and running again, next step is to publish the remainder of the code on github\n\ngroups-4.x (and staging) were updated to latest. I attempted to update GoCD, but it’s a bit of a yolo merge, since a few pieces all had to be updated at once due to new scons target=editor argument we need to follow https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/ (log in as guest) and test the release builds\n\n\nexport builds are being created again with the new scons naming scheme. They seem to work on linux (steam deck) at least.

I attempted to update GoCD, but it’s a bit of a yolo merge, since a few pieces all had to be updated at once due to new scons target=editor argument we need to follow https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/ (log in as guest) and test the release builds\n\n\nexport builds are being created again with the new scons naming scheme.
