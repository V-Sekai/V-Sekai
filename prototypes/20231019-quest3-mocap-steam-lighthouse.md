# Valve VR Ecosystem with Quest 3

The conversation between iFire and cyberpunkmermaid reveals an innovative idea of creating a portable VR setup. Here's the breakdown:

iFire has a cart with a PCVR computer in it. This setup streams to a Quest 3, which is a virtual reality headset. The system uses portable light houses on clamped sticks for tracking.

You can use 8 HTC or Tundra trackers motion capture. One tracker is dedicated to the continuous calibration with the Meta Quest 3 HMD and the SteamVR ecosystem. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/ArcticFox8515/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator/releases/tag/v1.4-bd_%2Baf-r5). Two are used for the foot, two for the shoulders, one for the chest, one for the hips (optional), and two for the knees (optional and not necessary).

The setup also includes 2 or 4 light houses and requires the purchase of Virtual Desktop for the Meta Quest 3.

The Master Mount L from Elgato is a key component of this setup. It's a space-saving standalone solution that can also be part of a modular rigging system for cameras, lights, and more. Its height is adjustable from 55 cm / 22 in up to 125 cm / 49 in.

This setup essentially turns your laptop into a mobile VR station, streaming your desktop to your Meta Quest 2 or 3. It's a creative approach to leveraging the power of the Valve VR ecosystem with the portability of the Quest series.
