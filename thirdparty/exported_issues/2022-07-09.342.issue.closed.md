### Request description

There's a tricky FontData upgrade.

I have made a staging Godot Engine branch and on groups I have made a fontdata-upgrade.

I don't want the godot master and godot groups-4.x to diverge too much.

Test if groups-staging-4.x engine launches and is join-able with 1 server and 2 client with the fontdata-upgrade branch and then merge both sides.

Unable to test itch build because of a chicken and egg dependency problem where itchio staging can only test staging + groups project git.

If done in error, the problem is that there will be an 1 hour production release downtime.

In cicd, can force release the previous version of the engine with the older groups project git hash. 

## Procedure 

1. Merge groups changes
2. Test using staging itch
3. Pause the release cicd to itch.
4. merge groups engine changes from staging engine 4. test itch
5. Wait until the engine is build and the groups is updated.
6. Unpause the itch butler upload pipeline
