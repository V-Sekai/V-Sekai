Openapi schema for the official asset library api.\n1. Elixir server implementation\n2. Patch to Godot Engine to add arbitrary asset libraries\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- More freedom.\n- Xananax said he'll use it. Xanax's games are made 100% of addons with assets and glue code being the game.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Different libraries\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->\n- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nCould be a few lines of script. Unsure of scope. The server can be a lot too.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nNot so core, but I can do it.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://github.com/godotengine/godot-asset-library/blob/master/API.md\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
