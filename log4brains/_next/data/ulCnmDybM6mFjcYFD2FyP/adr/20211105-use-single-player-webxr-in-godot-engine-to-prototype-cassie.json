Extract geometry class from Godot Engine 4.0 to 3.4.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Stable\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Slower than Godot Engine master\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Godot master as of 2021-11-05\n- Rejection Reason: Godot Master doesn't have WebXR on this date.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is a project proposal.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI found an approach to do it.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://godotengine.org/news\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
