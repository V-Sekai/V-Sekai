### Context and Problem Statement

Godot physics isn't treating us well.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Switch V-Sekai to use Godot Jolt physics. Jolt physics supports 64 bit floats.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. convert godot jolt to a c++ module
2. fix bugs 
3. ship

### Positive Consequences

1. The physics bugs are fixed.

### Negative Consequences

1. If we add Jolt physics, we don't have the budget for the top ranked features in V-Sekai.

### Option graveyard

_No response_

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

A physics engine is not a few lines of code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We don't really want to do this, since it is expensive. Need to weight in.

Technical leadership at Godot Engine was not satisfied with the non SAT based approach of JOLT.
