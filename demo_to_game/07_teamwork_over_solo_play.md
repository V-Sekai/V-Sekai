## 7. Teamwork Over Solo Play

The game places a strong emphasis on teamwork rather than solo play. This is a reflection of the cooperative nature of the game, where players are encouraged to form parties or teams to tackle challenges together.

- **Cooperative Gameplay**: The game is designed in such a way that many of its challenges and missions are best tackled as a team. This could involve strategizing together, combining different character abilities, or simply working together to overcome powerful enemies or complex puzzles. This design choice encourages social interaction and cooperation among players.

- **Forming Parties/Teams**: To facilitate this cooperative gameplay, the game allows players to form parties or teams. These groups can work together, plan strategies, and combine their strengths to overcome the game's challenges. This not only enhances the social aspect of the game but also adds an extra layer of strategic depth.

- **Overcoming Challenges Together**: By emphasizing teamwork, the game promotes a sense of camaraderie and shared achievement. When players overcome a difficult challenge together, it creates a rewarding experience that can be more satisfying than solo victories.
