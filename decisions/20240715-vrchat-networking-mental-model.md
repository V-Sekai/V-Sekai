# Proposed: Create a Mental Model of VRChat Networking

## The Context

In the realm of virtual reality, particularly within VRChat, understanding the networking model is crucial for developers. This proposal aims to create a comprehensive mental model of VRChat's networking system.

## The Problem Statement

Developers often struggle with the intricacies of VRChat's networking, leading to inefficient code and suboptimal user experiences. A clear and concise guide is needed to demystify the process.

## Describe How Your Proposal Will Work with Code, Pseudo-Code, Mock-Ups, or Diagrams

### Sending Data in VRChat

There are two primary methods to send data in VRChat:

1. **Udonsynced Variables**:

   - Mark variables as `[UdonSynced]`.
   - Call `RequestSerialization()` in the script to send a copy of the synced variables to all other clients.
   - Only the owner can call `RequestSerialization()`, so ensure you call `Networking.SetOwner()` first.
   - An event called `OnDeserialization` is triggered when a network packet is received.

2. **Network Events**:
   - Use `SendCustomNetworkEvent()` to send an event.
   - Specify a string that matches the name of a function taking no arguments; this function will run upon receiving the event.
   - Choose to send the event either to the owner or all clients.

```csharp
// Example of Udonsynced variable
[UdonBehaviourSyncMode(BehaviourSyncMode.Manual)]
public class SyncExample : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    [UdonSynced] private int syncedVariable;

    public void UpdateVariable(int newValue)
    {
        if (Networking.IsOwner(gameObject))
        {
            syncedVariable = newValue;
            RequestSerialization();
        }
    }

    public override void OnDeserialization()
    {
        // Handle deserialized data
    }
}

// Example of Network Event
public class EventExample : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public void TriggerEvent()
    {
        SendCustomNetworkEvent(VRC.Udon.Common.Interfaces.NetworkEventTarget.All, "HandleEvent");
    }

    public void HandleEvent()
    {
        // Handle the event
    }
}
```

## The Benefits

- **Improved Readability**: Clear guidelines enhance the readability of networking code.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity in how networking tasks are handled across different projects.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined processes make it easier for developers to implement networking features quickly.

## The Downsides

- **Initial Setup Time**: Establishing and fine-tuning the mental model requires an initial investment of time and resources.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Strict adherence to the model may limit creative solutions to unique problems.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative approaches such as manual editing or using different networking models were considered but ultimately impossible as we don't run VRChat.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In scenarios where highly specialized or technical networking solutions are required, additional human oversight may be necessary to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

## In Core and Done by Us

We need to understand how networking models work.

### Question: How should I represent the entire state in a networked application?

**Answer:** You want the entire state to be represented by your synced variables. If you have a one-time event, like a sound effect playing, you might be able to get away with sending a custom network event. However, one uses variables for 90% of networking tasks.

### Question: How can the order and exact value changes of three variables affect their interpretation in a networked system?

**Answer:** Assume we calculate the state of the world independently for each frame, without depending on previous frames. This means that while the exact values of the three variables are crucial for determining the current state, the order of changes within the same frame does not affect the final state interpretation at that frame.
