### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai discord is cumbersome to use.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Grant the "Member" role to all members who click a reaction from the Discord bot.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We need to review the code and set up a runner in kubernetes.

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use the community easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->

- Option: Use discord's standard moderation tools with mass ban. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This is actually a good feature. Need to re-evaluate. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We administrate the V-Sekai Discord.
