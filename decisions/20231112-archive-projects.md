## The Backdrop

The need for an effective project archival strategy has been highlighted by the experience of going through old projects without any structure or crucial data. This proposal aims to overcome this challenge in the context of V-Sekai projects.

## The Challenge

The main challenge is to create a structured and comprehensive archive of V-Sekai projects that will allow easy access and understanding of each project even years after its completion.

## The Strategy

The proposed strategy includes:

1. Leaving online projects that do not require maintenance or incur costs.
2. Creating a dedicated folder and subfolders for every year for projects that can't be left online.
3. Making screenshots and adding a README file to each project.
4. Backing up the database and keeping generated assets.
5. Saving the project to the Internet Archive if the platform is not owned.

## The Upside

This strategy will ensure that all V-Sekai projects are well-documented and easily accessible in the future. It will also help in preserving the history and evolution of V-Sekai projects over time.

## The Downside

The process might be time-consuming and require regular updates and maintenance.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative could be to use a cloud-based storage service for archiving projects. However, this might not provide the same level of organization and accessibility as the proposed strategy.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In cases where a project was short-lived or did not have significant impact, it might be decided to not include it in the archive.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this strategy should be implemented by the V-Sekai team as it directly affects the organization and preservation of their projects.
