## Context and Problem Statement

## Proposed Solution

## Implementation

* Wasm edge functions
* How much compute time?
* Data storage
* table editing ui
* Edge Function usecase: glb to godot engine packed scene

* serverless "deno" function glb -> godot packed scene into storage
* serverless "deno" function -> insert godot packed scene into server
* serverless "deno" function "hello" world -> return json hello world

## Positive Consequences

## Negative Consequences

## Option graveyard

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?
