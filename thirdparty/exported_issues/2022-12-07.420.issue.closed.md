### Context and Problem Statement

Godot Engine's soft body physics is 1. hard to configure 2. slow

We will focus on the slow problem.



### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We want to optimize runtime performance with the a preconditioner for cloth and deformable body simulation.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Figure out if it's compatible with Godot Engine's approach.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Option graveyard

_No response_

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Physics and softbody simulation isn't easy.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Looks cool, and I found it.
