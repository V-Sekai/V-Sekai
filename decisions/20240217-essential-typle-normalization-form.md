# Proposed: Implementation of Essential Tuple Normalization Form (ETNF) in V-Sekai

## The Context

In pursuit of enhancing data integrity, optimizing database performance, and standardizing data storage practices, V-Sekai proposes the adoption of the Essential Tuple Normalization Form (ETNF) across its database systems.

## The Problem Statement

V-Sekai's database systems currently lack a standardized approach to normalization, leading to data redundancy, inconsistency, and inefficiencies in data management. This inconsistency hampers the system's overall performance and scalability.

## Proposal Overview: ETNF Implementation

We propose the implementation of ETNF, a normalization form that offers an optimal balance between eliminating redundancy and maintaining manageable complexity in database schemas. ETNF is positioned between the fourth normal form (4NF) and the fifth normal form (5NF), providing a sophisticated yet practical approach to database normalization.

### Comprehensive Description of ETNF

ETNF, or Essential Tuple Normalization Form, addresses the shortcomings of existing normalization forms by focusing on the elimination of unnecessary redundancy without the extensive decomposition associated with 5NF. It is designed to ensure that every tuple (record) in the database is essential, meaning that no tuple can be generated as a combination of other tuples in the database. This form is particularly effective in relational databases where constraints are governed by functional dependencies (FDs) and join dependencies (JDs).

#### Example 1: Non-Normalized Data

Consider a V-Sekai database table that stores information about parts, suppliers, and the respective shipments. The table is not normalized and contains redundant data.

| SupplierID | SupplierName | PartID | PartName | ShipmentQuantity |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------ | -------- | ---------------- |
| S1         | Alice        | P1     | Part1    | 100              |
| S1         | Alice        | P2     | Part2    | 200              |
| S2         | Bob          | P1     | Part1    | 150              |
| S2         | Bob          | P3     | Part3    | 300              |
| S3         | Charlie      | P2     | Part2    | 250              |

In the above table, the `SupplierName` and `PartName` are repeated for each `SupplierID` and `PartID`, respectively. This redundancy can lead to inconsistencies and anomalies.

#### Example 2: ETNF Normalized Data

To normalize the above table into ETNF, we would decompose it into three separate tables: `Supplier`, `Part`, and `Shipment`.

##### Supplier Table

| SupplierID | SupplierName |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| S1         | Alice        |
| S2         | Bob          |
| S3         | Charlie      |

##### Part Table

| PartID | PartName |
| ------ | -------- |
| P1     | Part1    |
| P2     | Part2    |
| P3     | Part3    |

##### Shipment Table

| SupplierID | PartID | ShipmentQuantity |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| S1         | P1     | 100              |
| S1         | P2     | 200              |
| S2         | P1     | 150              |
| S2         | P3     | 300              |
| S3         | P2     | 250              |

In the normalized tables, each tuple is essential and there is no redundancy. The `SupplierName` is not repeated for each shipment from the same supplier, and similarly, the `PartName` is not repeated for each shipment of the same part. This design adheres to the principles of ETNF, enhancing data integrity and consistency.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Redundancy Reduction**: ETNF effectively reduces data redundancy by ensuring that all data stored in the database is essential and non-repetitive.
- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: By minimizing redundancy, ETNF enhances the integrity and consistency of the database, making data more reliable and accurate.
- **Balanced Complexity**: ETNF offers a middle ground between 4NF and 5NF, reducing redundancy without the complexity of decomposing relations into smaller, more numerous relations as often required by 5NF.

### Operational Implications for Database Practitioners

1. **Dependency Analysis**: The first step involves a detailed analysis of all functional and join dependencies across the database to identify redundancy and determine the scope for normalization to ETNF.

2. **Schema Evaluation and Restructuring**: Evaluate existing database schemas against ETNF criteria, identifying areas where restructuring is required to eliminate redundancy and enhance efficiency.

3. **Practical Application and Migration**: Implement the ETNF principles through schema redesign and careful data migration, ensuring that the transition does not impact data integrity or system availability.

## Benefits for V-Sekai

- **Enhanced Data Integrity**: Implementation of ETNF will significantly improve the integrity and reliability of V-Sekai's data.
- **Optimized Performance**: By reducing redundancy, ETNF will streamline data storage and retrieval processes, enhancing overall system performance.
- **Strategic Data Management**: Adopting ETNF aligns with strategic initiatives for scalable, efficient, and consistent data management practices.
