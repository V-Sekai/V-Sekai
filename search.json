It details an AI framework and production pipeline that allow designers to craft huge amount of AI archetypes quickly and flexibly. Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles.

Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network."

    "text": "Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\nA. Spawning\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\nB. Consistent References\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\nC. State Synchronization\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\nD. Standard Interaction Protocols\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\nE. Network Security Model:\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\nF. Inter-entity Isolation\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\nG. Abstraction\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\nH. Physics\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\nSpawn Type (i). Map builtins\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\nSpawn Type (ii). Map spawns\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\nSpawn Type (iii). Avatar spawns\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\nNotes about Entity parenting:\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity."

    "text": "Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nhumbletim, codefloof, iFire and lyuma debated the meaningfulness of building Gltf extensions.\niFire constructed an argument we are making a Gltf container for the metaverse. A metaverse container where each part is separated because of limited engineering bandwidth. We brought up the point Gltf isn’t unknown and is unknown.\nLyuma can’t entirely agree that Gltf extensions are “separated.” Gltf extensions are independent extensions that are good from an engineering perspective.\nLyuma reaffirmed his suspicions that OMI standards are not so valuable in isolation. Humbletim raised valid concerns that the Unity work had not progressed, and Mozilla Hubs had not merged the OMI audio emitter code. We may need Unity platforms and Mozilla Hubs to bootstrap the ecosystem, but tools like Gltf transform could sidestep it.\niFire also constructed a strawman of how operating inside a platform is seamless, and transferring between platforms is like pulling teeth. Still, a strawman isn’t something that helped facilitate the discussion so Lyuma may have misunderstood that part. iFire described the unity package vs others. Lyuma agrees that this is valid; other formats could be deemed “interoperable,” more expressive than Gltf.\nIn Lyuma’s mind, it’s a fair X point that already exists. So why work on Y? Why does Gltf 3d format if we have Fbx 3d format etc.?\nLyuma doesn’t think we need to assume that there must be only one standard.\nWe’re trying to see if we can do better by working together than taking some existing closed format and using it verbatim.\nOMI work is valid even if a unity package standard exists. We don’t need to be the only standard.\niFire didn’t exhaust all the details of the point, but we can make a Gltf transform for as many standards we can catalogue."

Currently probably the best way to learn Kaolin is to take a look through the documentation and look for relevant functions. We hope to make more demos which will make learning Kaolin smoother in the future.\nThe functions which will be useful to you would be:\nkaolin.io.obj.import_mesh to import a mesh.\ntorch.meshgrid to generate a bunch of 3D coordinates of a voxel grid.\nkaolin.metrics.trianglemesh.point_to_mesh_distance to get the distance function for those points.\nkaolin.ops.mesh.check_sign to get the sign of the points to multiply with the distance.\nkaolin.ops.conversions.voxelgrids_to_trianglemeshes to convert the SDF grid to a mesh."

    "text": "VMD on VRM AnimationTree Node\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nEirexe made a VMD player based on Lox’s work.\nThis new ability means we now have a viable way to load VMD motions and use them as a VRM motion player.\n\n\nDescribe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nWe want to make an AnimationTree node to drive Miku Miku VMD motion and add other procedural animation features to blend motion on the VRM Avatar.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nHowever, we need to make some changes to the AnimationTree UI editor to make the changes possible. We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Who needs a changelog?\n\n\nPeople do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what’s in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nKeep a changelog.\n\nUse the https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-proposals #repository as a placeholder.\nDelay migrations to main project #repository to a later date.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot code.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe are the best to know what changed.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Since Godot has no means for preserving the original filename on import when the files are not present, doing a fix to the FBX2glTF tool won’t quite cover my necessary usecase, so I think extracting the map in the tooling is easiest.

I think we’re going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.\n\nRadical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.\nAdd BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.\nMeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints?

Very ugly hack to fix one of the bugs though, strange issue. Some slight remaining avatar issues, but it’s mostly working now it seems.\n2021-05-14 02:17:44Z fire: Added three pictures and a video.\n2021-05-14 01:33:44Z fire: VOX to VRM fun.

It’s really exciting to get this much imported with just a couple clicks and about 30 seconds of waiting\n2021-05-13 21:37:01Z lyuma: it’s a bit of random chance that it looks so similar: the skydome and some objects like flowers have completely custom shaders, so those will have to be ported manually\n2021-05-13 21:36:32Z Saracen: This is actually starting to look like the original now\n2021-05-13 21:36:27Z Saracen: Woah!\n2021-05-13 21:36:04Z lyuma: Unidot Importer: Got lighting and basic environment settings importing.

Should result in more accurate VR proportions.\n2021-05-13 04:26:05Z fire: Rebased my godot 4.0 stack so I can go back to my vrm viewer thing\n2021-05-13 03:14:34Z Saracen: One more patch just to allow direct assignment of upper and lower bones by ID, but it seems to be working now. Good job! It’s now possible to use avatars with in-between bones.\n2021-05-13 03:00:37Z Saracen: Basically, the new code to automatically assign the next bone in the chain assumed the skeleton was assigned, even though it can be null.\n2021-05-13 02:55:04Z MMMaellon#2053 whoa wait why was it crashing\n2021-05-13 02:47:41Z Saracen: Fixed RenIK crashing.\n2021-05-13 00:48:18Z fire: Reviewed https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46568.

It seems that all that was needed was to transform the “tip” and “target” headings of an IKBoneChain by the inverse transform of the root. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/841673340740829234/unknown.png 🌅 (1)\n2021-05-11 03:32:10Z fire: Whoo debugged EWBIK the entire day, and removed the hacks to reveal the broken core to be rebuilt! Thanks Eron!\n2021-05-10 17:21:03Z fire: Evaluated EWBIK with Motion Retargeting. Suggestions included adding a position indication (with scale) as a child of the correction node that is a child of the bone attachment and olving only one frame at a time. No conclusions yet, because ewbik is too broken.\n2021-05-10 02:48:21Z fire: Working with Eron on ewbik. Next meeting at 9am or later.\n2021-05-09 22:31:35Z fire: Working out a system where we create targets from the other skeletal animation using bone attachments and then a corresponding correction node underneath it. The ik solver then uses those correction node targets as the target.\n2021-05-09 17:22:13Z Saracen: Support for ordered grid super sampling and camera position-based bill-boarding added thanks to help from Silent and Lyuma\n2021-05-09 16:08:30Z fire: Many patches from トカゲ were merged today /.

Also, you can see it fails to port custom shaders like the skybox.)\n2021-05-08 10:42:42Z lyuma: squiddingme helped provide me with source files to their beautiful Traveler’s Rift, and I am finally able to import it using Unidot. This part was all automated, and includes collision meshes for all of the separate pickup objects, as well as light sources. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/840539201987936306/TravelersRift.jpg 👍 (1)\n2021-05-08 06:55:06Z fire: Chatted with humbletim about importing an existing armature into EWBIK Java\n2021-05-08 06:30:40Z MMMaellon#2053 You were talking about it the other day, but all that I got was that it was difficult to set up. idk what it actually did\n2021-05-08 06:30:13Z MMMaellon#2053 what does matrix server giv us?\n2021-05-08 06:28:45Z lyuma: “1.
