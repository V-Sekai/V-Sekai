# Proposed: Godot Animation streaming

## The Context

Animation streaming is a technique for handling extremely long animations. It involves loading only portions of the animation data as needed, which helps manage memory efficiently and ensures smooth playback without requiring the entire animation to be loaded into memory simultaneously.

## The Problem Statement

We need a system to handle the streaming of long animations in a way that minimizes memory usage and ensures smooth playback. The system should be configurable and handle various animation lengths and complexities.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

We have a resource, `AnimationStreamingData`, which, when exported, is a custom binary resource containing animation pages. Export animation compressed data to this.

If you have an LRU of pages in the animation resource, you can customize this in the project settings (animation page LRU). I would like to know the number of pages, time, or size. Time is best, say 2/3 seconds.

Have a particular track for streamed animations. Always load the first 2/3 seconds of animation (buffer size). For the rest, while playing the animation, you can use `WorkerThreadPool` to queue loading resource pages ahead of you on a thread. Always strive to have 2/3 seconds (again, buffer size) ahead of the playback cursor. After you are done with a page, you can free it.

`AnimationStreamingData` should be a binary format, custom-made, with all pages saved.

Animation streaming must be restricted to compressed keyframe pages.

When opening this, you should have an index (file offset, size, and position in the timeline) that you load first from it, then stream pages as you go.

### AnimationStreamingData (Stored on Disk and Runtime Component)

1. Exporting animation compressed data to `AnimationStreamingData`.
2. Implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for animation pages, configurable in the project settings (animation page LRU).
3. Loading the first 2/3 seconds of animation as a buffer.
4. Using `WorkerThreadPool` to queue loading resource pages ahead of the playback cursor.
5. Freeing pages after they are no longer needed.

```gdscript
class AnimationStreamingData:
    var index = []  # Array of arrays (file_offset, size, position_in_timeline)
    var pages = {}
    var ring_buffer = RingBuffer.new()  # Custom type for ring buffer
    var usage = []  # Track usage for LRU

    func _init():
        load_index()
        var buffer_size = 16  # Example size, adjust as needed
        ring_buffer.resize(buffer_size)
        usage.resize(buffer_size)

    func load_index():
        # Load index from binary resource
        pass

    func get_page_info(page_number):
        # Retrieve page info from the index
        var page_info = index[page_number]
        return {"file_offset": page_info[0], "size": page_info[1], "position_in_timeline": page_info[2]}

    func store_page(page_number, page_data):
        # Store compressed animation page data
        pages[page_number] = page_data

    func load_page(page_number):
        # Load compressed animation page data
        return pages.get(page_number, null)

    func fetch_page(page_number):
        # Fetch page data from AnimationStreamingData
        return load_page(page_number)

    func stream_page(page_number):
        # Stream page data from RingBuffer
        if ring_buffer.data_left() > 0:
            var page = ring_buffer.read()
            update_usage(page_number)
            return page
        else:
            return null

    func write_page(page_data, page_number):
        # Write page data to RingBuffer
        if ring_buffer.space_left() < 1:
            # Find and replace the least recently used page
            var lru_index = find_lru()
            ring_buffer.write_pos = lru_index
        ring_buffer.write(page_data)
        update_usage(page_number)

    func update_usage(page_number):
        # Update usage list
        for i in range(usage.size()):
            usage[i] += 1
        usage[page_number] = 0

    func find_lru():
        # Find the least recently used page
        var max_usage = -1
        var lru_index = -1
        for i in range(usage.size()):
            if usage[i] > max_usage:
                max_usage = usage[i]
                lru_index = i
        return lru_index
```

### AnimationPlayer

```gdscript
class AnimationPlayer:
    var buffer_size = 2.0 / 3.0
    var worker_pool = WorkerThreadPool.new()
    var streaming_data = AnimationStreamingData.new()

    func _init():
        streaming_data.load_index()

    func play_animation():
        # Load initial buffer
        load_initial_buffer()
        # Stream pages ahead of playback cursor
        stream_pages_ahead()

    func load_initial_buffer():
        # Load the first 2/3 seconds of animation into RingBuffer
        for i in range(buffer_size):
            var page_info = streaming_data.get_page_info(i)
            var page = streaming_data.fetch_page(page_info)
            if page != null:
                streaming_data.write_page(page, i)

    func stream_pages_ahead():
        # Queue loading of pages ahead of playback cursor
        worker_pool.queue_task(callable(self, "_load_next_page"))

    func _load_next_page():
        var next_page_info = streaming_data.get_page_info(buffer_size)
        var next_page = streaming_data.fetch_page(next_page_info)
        if next_page != null:
            streaming_data.write_page(next_page, buffer_size)

    func free_page(page):
        # Free page after use
        streaming_data.ring_buffer.advance_read(1)
```

## The Benefits

Efficient memory usage by loading only necessary animation data. This allows for the import and streaming of extremely long animations with configurable settings to suit different project needs.

1. **Character Animations**: In an open-world game, characters may have complex animations such as walking, running, jumping, and interacting with the environment. Animation streaming ensures that only the necessary parts of these animations are loaded, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

2. **Environmental Animations**: Open-world games often feature dynamic environments with animations like trees swaying, water flowing, and weather changes. Streaming these animations helps maintain a seamless experience without overloading the system.

3. **Cutscenes and Cinematics**: Long cutscenes and cinematic sequences can be streamed to avoid loading large animation files simultaneously, ensuring smooth transitions and playback.

4. **NPC Interactions**: Non-player characters (NPCs) in open-world games may have varied and lengthy interaction animations. Streaming these animations allows for more complex and varied NPC behaviours without compromising performance.

## The Downsides

- Increased complexity in animation handling.
- Potential latency in loading pages if not appropriately managed.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to load the entire animation into memory, simplifying the implementation but resulting in high memory usage and potential performance issues for long animations.

## The Infrequent Use Case

Handling extremely short animations where streaming might not be necessary.

## In Core and Done by Us

The V-Sekai development team will implement this proposal as part of the core functionality for handling animations in the Godot Engine.
