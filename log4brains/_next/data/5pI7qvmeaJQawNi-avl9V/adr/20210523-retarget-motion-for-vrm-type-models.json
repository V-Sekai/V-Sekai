In the Animation section, enable the following options\n    - [x] Scale FPS\n    - [x] Scene Duration\n- Use the Pose Transfer tab (vertical tab part of the \"N\" options panel?)\n    - Source: the imported BVH armature\n    - Target: the imported avatar armature\n    - Click the Rebuild Bone List\n        - manually map over any bones not automatically mapped\n        - eg: LeftLowerArm => \"Left elbow\"\n        - note: it is possible to save your mapping to .json and reuse\n    - Click Retarget Animation\n        - retargeting may take several minutes\n- Verify retargeting by playing the animation via the Blender play button\n- Export the scene as a .glb (using default settings)\n\n### Common Problems\n\nQ: Retargeted animation seems to have legs crossed / backwards\n\nA: This can happen if you import a VRM avatar as a .gltf (re-import using the VRM importer add-on)\n\nQ: Legs/arms bend unnaturally \n\nA: Check the armature bone name mappings\n  - at most, each target bone name should appear once\n  - leave BVH joints not present in your avatar blank\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n**Thanks to humbletim for being the scribe**\n\n**Thanks to lyuma for being test pilot flying these steps**\n\n### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Have a generally robust process of retargeting motions to VRM-type models.\n\n### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Only VRM\n- MMD does not work.\n\n## Option graveyard: Adobe Mixamo\n\nList the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)\n\n* Proprietary Online Service\n* Blackbox technology\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nMotion retargeting is not trivial offline or online.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need motions for our character controller without using an off-the-shelf black box solution.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://www.blender.org/\n- https://hackmd.io/EmOAt375S8KFqaNdPDJCXQ\n- https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai-Blender-tools/tree/main/addons/blender-skeletal-motion-animate\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
