### Context and Problem Statement

Get the net demo ready for merge into V-Sekai

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

I want to get the net demo ready for presentation.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. jitter buffer
2. bit packing
3. perfect prediction using ballistic trajectory

### Positive Consequences

We'll have lag free VR network sync.

### Negative Consequences

May have cheating with this type of replication.

### Option graveyard

Option: The status quo.
Rejection Reason: This solves nothing.


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not trivial.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are doing this.
