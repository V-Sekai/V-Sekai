</ul>
<section id="simplified-setup-and-advanced-solver-system" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simplified-setup-and-advanced-solver-system">Simplified Setup and Advanced Solver System</h2>
<p>The team has introduced a feature that allows for easy setup with just a single click. Additionally, they’re now utilizing an advanced system known as the Many Bones’ solver.</p>
</section>
<section id="graphics-processing-unit-gpu-performance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graphics-processing-unit-gpu-performance">Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Performance</h2>
<p>There were some concerns about how much time the GPU was spending on processing the shader - think of the shader like a set of instructions telling the GPU how to draw each pixel. The frame times, or the speed at which frames are processed, seemed to be slower than expected. However, it was clarified that these tests were being run in a mode designed for finding errors (debug mode), not for optimal performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="comparing-performance-across-platforms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparing-performance-across-platforms">Comparing Performance Across Platforms</h2>
<p>The team discussed how their system’s performance stacks up against other virtual reality social platforms. They used different types of hardware for these comparisons, similar to comparing the performance of different cars using various types of roads and conditions.</p>
</section>
<section id="tailoring-performance-for-different-devices" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tailoring-performance-for-different-devices">Tailoring Performance for Different Devices</h2>
<p>The team also talked about how to best optimize their system for different devices. This is akin to tuning a car’s engine differently depending on whether it’s going to be driven in the city or on a racetrack.</p>
</section>
<section id="rendering-avatars" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rendering-avatars">Rendering Avatars</h2>
<p>There were discussions about the challenges of rendering avatars, especially when there are multiple avatars on the screen at once. It’s like trying to paint multiple portraits at the same time - the more you have, the harder it gets. The team discussed the need for guidelines to help avatar creators optimize their designs for less powerful hardware.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-plans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, the team plans to conduct more tests, particularly focusing on how well their system handles complex 3D models on Android devices. They also aim to create a benchmark scenario where they expect good performance across most platforms, much like setting a standard track to test different cars’ performances.</p>

<section id="changelog-2023-05" class="level1">
<h1>Changelog 2023-05</h1>
<p>In May 2023, significant progress was made in the Godot community and V-Sekai project. Key developments include the implementation of WebAssembly modules for Godot Engine 4, improvements to the V-Sekai Godot Engine fork, and advancements in Unidot’s FBX humanoid support. Additionally, there were updates to the manual site, suggestions for Blender VRM drag-and-drop support, and bug fixes related to LODs.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/ashtonmeuser/godot-wasm/tree/godot-4 Implements wasm modules for Godot Engine 4.</li>
<li>Fire has chatgpt4 api access.</li>
<li>Merged godot-wasm into V-Sekai Godot Engine fork for experimenting with user generated scripting and optimization of computation.</li>
<li>vsk_speech branch of V-Sekai Godot Engine passes cicd again!!</li>
<li>Revised and optimized the manual site.</li>
<li>Suggested that .VRM drag and drop support is added to Blender. https://github.com/mika-f/blender-drag-and-drop/issues/34#issuecomment-1539429579</li>
<li>Use a better representation of feminine and masculine avatars</li>
<li>Fixing bugs with lods</li>
</ul>
<section id="unidot-update-summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unidot-update-summary">Unidot Update Summary</h2>
<p>Lyuma has been working on implementing imported humanoid FBX support in Unidot, including bone guessing. The current implementation supports FBX source models and performs bone name guessing when humanDescription is empty. However, it does not yet support humanoid .anim clips, and there are known issues applying Animator components to already-imported models.</p>
<p>After fixing a typo in Fix Silhouette, Lyuma reported that FBX humanoid animation import in Unidot seems much closer. They also implemented support for “Copy from other Avatar” to handle conversion of Maya FBX files with the first frame posed like the animation. This allows using the T-pose of another model as the rest pose.</p>
<p>Lyuma shared their progress on Twitter, showcasing the effectiveness of Unidot-Importer by VSekaiOfficial and Godot 4.0’s new humanoid retargeter system. The Godot Engine community also discovered the team’s GLTF work, as seen in a tweet by Bramwell.</p>
<p>Gamefromscratch covered Godot -&gt; Unity migration in a YouTube video, highlighting the use of barcoderdev’s version of FBX2glTF with Unidot, which might solve the pivot issue encountered earlier.</p>

<p>Restored AEC3 to speech for echo cancellation.</p>

<h1>2022-12-06</h1>
<p>Some reorganization of the the V-Sekai-game issues and the proposal repository to move bugs to V-Sekai-game and enhancements to the proposal repository. Organized the issues and put some videos for some of them. The Japanese tokyo world bug with the 30 second lag between load was funny.</p>
<p>Moved enhancements to https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io and bugs to https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-game/issues.</p>
<p>Godot Speech now includes echo cancellation using WebRTC AEC3. Thanks iFire for adding it and getting it building. (some of the builds had issues but they should be resolved) .</p>

<h1>2022-12-12</h1>
<p>MMMaellon updated the V-Sekai game fov to 70.</p>
<p>Lyuma — Today at 00:34</p>
<p>We had an animation meeting with people in the Godot rocketchat.</p>
<p>We went through the issues in this list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Al_PUHAUJE0S3XXtBpmA6MQIA_9sx57BXEisW1EAB0/edit#gid=0 Google Docs (Saracen / Lyuma / Fire / Tokage) A list of open issues/bugs/PRs th…</p>
<p>Pretty excited about some of these changes if they can get merged, especially the ability to extend and override AnimationNode classes, such as from a GDExtension plugin</p>
<p>We agreed to punt SkeletonModificationStack3D until 4.1. I think we will remove it from 4.0 because it is very buggy in its present state and there is not enough time to develop a good system for IK</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lyuma">2022-11-29 - Lyuma</h2>
<p>V-Sekai-game Player spawning should be working again (see their name tag at least). There’s an issue with the default sky_celebration map caused by “TestEntity” which has scene_file_path==“” and that breaks the validation logic, preventing the player from spawning, and most default maps don’t work. You need to use Mobile Dragon Shop (very dark) or Tokyo Map</p>
<p>Note that avatars are currently not working. I think I’m getting closer to identifying where the validation is causing trouble.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-state-of-v-sekai-game">Current state of V-Sekai-Game</h3>
<p>We are working on a v2 of the network architecture based on Godot’s network spawn &amp; sync system, so a lot of the code I’m editing right now is kind of legacy at this point. The new network implementation should drastically simplify the code and eliminate dozens of complex GDScript files from being needed. I still want to get this demo stable, since we will still be using the player controller and avatar loader from it</p>

</div>
<p>The new v2 network demo can be found at https://github.com/V-Sekai/net_demo if you’re curious. There’s no VR support planned for net_demo, but it should serve as a strong foundation going forward.</p>
<p>Avatars should show up again. There was some code mistake that triggered only when the default “mirror” was disabled and caused avatars not to instantiate, but I didn’t notice because I had turned it on in my checkout</p>
<p>I also fixed the default sky celebration map</p>
<p>Avatar bone rotations are currently broken with this setup. Seems like the head always faces a certain direction:</p>

<p>Lyuma — 01/10/2022 I have pushed internal and external resource whitelisting at the ResrouceLoader (ResourceFormatLoaderBinary) level as a Godot engine patch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example of what gets printed when the above script with OS.alert() attempts to be loaded</p>
<pre><code>ERROR: user://asset_cache/81dd12d03686
0a08faba06a1b47a3a29.scn:Resource of unrecognized type in file: GDScript.
   at: load (core/io/resource_format_binary.cpp:789)
ERROR: Failed loading resource: user://asset_cache/81dd12d036860a08faba06a1b47a3a29.scn. Make sure resources have been imported by opening the project in the editor at least once.</code></pre>
<p>Note that I was forced to rebase to the latest build which includes the new build system (target=editor) most of the code I changed is in the private gitlab repo. once things stabilize and we get the build system up and running again, next step is to publish the remainder of the code on github</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>groups-4.x (and staging) were updated to latest. I attempted to update GoCD, but it’s a bit of a yolo merge, since a few pieces all had to be updated at once due to new scons target=editor argument we need to follow https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/ (log in as guest) and test the release builds</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>export builds are being created again with the new scons naming scheme. They seem to work on linux (steam deck) at least. Don’t have access to a windows machine right now</p>

<p>New contributors this week:</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Malek">@Malek</span> Awesome for being around 🐱. Contributed to designs and cheering us when we succeed. Fixed the issue with the ci/cd with the recurse submodules. Too much to list!</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="gamethecupdog">@gamethecupdog</span> Helped us figured out some problems with AMD vr and V-sekai. We debugged the AMD VR launch issues and talked about fixing the vignette settings in the ui https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/issues/378</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="meowses">@meowses</span> For supporting us and watching our presentation.</p>

<p>iFire (he, him) — Today at 12:34 Turned off the mesh mirror mode for avatars because of playtesting confusion.</p>
<p>Lyuma — Today at 13:04 makes sense. at some point we can add a mirror, and we need a map aligned at the right place, or a script added to maps which define where the ““mirrors”” are (there can be more than one since it’s just duplicating meshes which is cool)</p>
<p>iFire (he, him) — Today at 14:47 I added https://github.com/TokageItLab/realtime_retarget to V-Sekai’s godot engine c++ modules. Please test, <span class="citation" data-cites="トカゲ">@トカゲ</span> is looking for feedback.</p>
<p>tefusion’s gdextension addon https://github.com/tefusion/godot-subdiv is now published. https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1488</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="humble-contributions-and-places-to-start">2022-10-22 Humble contributions and places to start? ^^</h2>
<section id="premise" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="premise">Premise:&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>betalars is working on making Chaos Computer Club more accessible.</li>
<li>There has been development to create an online-platform for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress">Chaos Communication Congress</a> using Godot</li>
<li>It is planned to be deployed in browser, limiting it to Godot 3 for now</li>
<li>Realistically, the Congress Experience software will not be production-ready before Godot4, so starting with Godot 3 only sets us up for tech-debt and also makes cooperation with V-sekai impossible, so it was the wrong decision originally and is now being reverted.</li>
<li>Based on limited contributors and also limited time, a Prototype in Godot 3 has been scrapped and betalars reached out to the V-Sekai team for some collaboration and humble contributions</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-are-constraints" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-constraints">What are constraints?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Milas needs to write a masters thesis on accessibility-driven Game-Development</li>
<li>At the end of December of each year, CCC holds a big conference, this year it is going to be a decentralised bunch of small-scale events due to the pandemic</li>
<li>iFire wants to be able to present meaningful progress by march 2023</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits-of-joining-online-chaos-experience-development-efforts-into-v-sekai">Benefits of joining online-chaos-experience development efforts into v-sekai</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pretty much all goals align …
<ul>
<li>Make it FOSS</li>
<li>Allow for player interaction and expression in an online space</li>
<li>Make 3D-level building accessible for players</li>
<li>Use Godot Engine</li>
<li>Encourage for tinkering and hacking (of the white-hat variety of course)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>… except for the fact, that online-chaos was developed for desktop browsers and not VR-Devices</li>
<li>V-Sekai is engineering-driven and lacks in UX and Design, which betalars has more knowledge in, so there is potential for synergy</li>
<li>If this collaboration is successful, it would introduce the project into a big community of developers, some of which will be happy to contribute further code</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="risks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risks">Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting distracted by shiny things</strong></li>
<li>There’s currently limited interest in the chaos community at large and Betalars is still pretty junior in experience despite leading the effort of building an online-world</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="talking-points-in-the-meeting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="talking-points-in-the-meeting">Talking Points in the Meeting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility
<ul>
<li>V-Sekai is interested in this subject, there’s an argument to be had, that XR has great potential for people with disabilities
<ul>
<li>Not having to leave their flat for social interaction is a plus</li>
<li>Being able to choose to be stealth with a bodily disability</li>
<li>More intuitive controls with tracking</li>
<li>Hand tracking can be used for signing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even for for visually impaired people, there are options to interact</li>
<li>Buttons
<ul>
<li>Rumble</li>
<li>Sound Feedback</li>
<li>There’s a lot of potential for work and research here, that would also benefit the godot-community by add-on development</li>
</ul></li>
<li>… and maybe by politely asking for some vital accessibility features to be pushed upstream</li>
<li>Concrete Projects are:
<ul>
<li>Subtitles</li>
<li>Introducing a Layer for alternate text / screen-reader Label3D</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Level Generation
<ul>
<li>Currently there is a lot of interest in the community on this subject, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeosVR">NeosVR</a>, a project with great level-building UX, has been frozen</li>
<li>Godot has a solid 3D-Level generator, that can be used by “power-users” to create 3D-Scenes</li>
<li>Expanding its feature set could benefit the Godot Engine Community at large</li>
<li>There’s the need for intuitive tools for the average user to create cool stuff in 3D
<ul>
<li>Voxel-Editors are a great first step, as they are an intuitive tool for blocking out 3D-shapes</li>
<li>Voxel Editors can be extended with</li>
<li>“Smart Voxel objects”, that can generate stuff like staircases, roofs, fences etc, that are a pain to block out within the voxel grid (and expanding the voxel grid)
<ul>
<li>3D-Generators, that based on the existing mesh can build plants for instance</li>
<li>Convenient Prop-Placement</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Level Generation References
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd9C90G0lQo">EverQuest Next Landmark - Detail building tools</a></li>

<li>Minecraft</li>
</ul></li>
<li>AI-Assisted Level Generation will probably also be a thing soon</li>
<li>Designing fun player-interaction Concepts
<ul>
<li>Betalars would like to work on it, but it is hard</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Making pretty Characters
<ul>
<li>Betalars has been working on a sims-style character generator</li>
<li>Current state can be found on <a href="https://gitlab.com/divocrew/design/-/tree/chavatars">gitlab</a>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully will also benefit Godot Engine community</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Developing a Tablet-Mode for V-Sekai
<ul>
<li>There has been effort put into creating a Non-VR interaction mode</li>
<li>Currently it is pretty janky and not thought through</li>
<li>Betalars would like to improve this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fire’s V-Sekai priorities:
<ol type="1">
<li>a better setting to be in</li>
<li>communications between at least two people</li>
<li>better character motion via constraints, spring bones, and animations</li>
<li>better character models (betalars has a character creation system that they already developed as possible collaboration points)</li>
</ol></li>

<h1>Changelog 2022-04</h1>
<p>Moved issues into the tracker.</p>
<section id="section" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section">2022-04-18</h2>
<p>Worked with manifold csg library author and was able to remove the boost dependency. https://github.com/elalish/manifold/pull/92</p>
<p>Also published a first draft on a Godot Engine master branch. See the issue for details.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section-1">2022-04-05</h2>
<p>Lyuma</p>
<p>Made a lot of progress towards animation import in Unidot. Godot’s node system means that some paths become different: for example, meshes have to be reparented to skeletons; or extra levels in the hierarchy to keep track of physics bodies.</p>
<p>To this end, it is now keeping a lookup dictionary from path and component to fileID (which can be mapped to Godot node) which means animation support should be close.</p>
<p>(Also, they made a major change to the import system in 2019 which affects id numbering. Still working on it)</p>
<p>Pushed a major update to Unidot, mostly in the post_import script. It should now generate paths much more accurately to the original file, and implemented the hashing algorithm used by Unity 2019 for file ID generation, for example generating ids like 919132149155446097 for the root object.</p>
<p>This has fixed some assets exported from Unity 2019 like below, which used to fail to resolve the fileIDs for meshes! <span class="citation" data-cites="iFire">@iFire</span></p>
<p>Made some progress with terrain import in Unidot. It will import textures, normalmaps and splatmaps (creating an appropriate ShaderMaterial). My plan is to implement trees and grass using MultimeshInstance objects. With this I also now support texture assets. Texture Arrays seem to fail internally. Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn’t implemented on Godot’s end, but we’ll get there…</p>
<p>performance-wise, I think it’s now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I’m using tristrips so it’s mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development. (if you’re interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general)</p>
<p>Terrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.</p>
<p>I also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don’t understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I’d rather work on something else.</p>

<p>MMMaellon: Didn’t we use to have an IK channel? Anyway here’s some of my ideas on how I plan to revamp RenIK. I’m still hoping that EWBIK takes over RENIK’s IK solving one day, so I’m focusing on improving the walk cycle and leaving IK solving alone https://mmmaellon.notion.site/Semi-Deterministic-Walk-Cycles-dbe1dcaa307e4fb9b85dd6ee920de20c</p>
<p>iFire — 07/11/2021: Groups update to the latest Godot. 1. intersect rays api changed. 2. misc crash if precondition fails return Oops forgot to upload a few branches.</p>
<p>iFire — 08/11/2021: https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-blender Now works on my Linux. Need some testing for Windows and Mac. Save a blend file into the godot project and it’ll be openable as scene through tricks.</p>
<p>iFire — 08/11/2021: Will be around in voice call for an 30m to 1 hour.</p>
<p>iFire — 09/11/2021: Cleared some godot engine github backlog. Wheeee</p>

<li>2021-10-04 08:21:47Z lyuma: トカゲ let’s move this to #animation … but basically there are three different proposals from Reduz.</li>
<li>2021-10-04 08:21:42Z トカゲ: So it should not support A pose -&gt; T pose</li>

<li>2021-10-04 08:18:08Z lyuma: I believe this proposal is sort of a generalization of the retargeting system you might find in Unity, without going into specifics on the implementation of the retargeting: what Reduz calls a “Retargeter” is what you would call an “Avatar” in Unity.</li>
