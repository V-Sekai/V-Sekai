# VR MMOG Project Design

## 1. Introduction

The project at hand is a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Game (VR MMOG). This game aims to provide an immersive co-op experience, where players can team up with friends to tackle challenges in a dungeon-style setting.

## 2. Player Experience

The goal is to create a game that encourages teamwork and moments of co-op improvisation. Players will work together using their unique abilities to overcome each challenge. The key feelings that the player will experience are cooperation, strategy, and triumph over shared obstacles.

## 3. Gadgets Instead of Classes

Instead of having distinct classes, players will have access to various gadgets that enable them to perform a wide range of actions:

- **Object Manipulation**: Move objects around by blocking or pushing them.
- **Long-Range Targeting**: Aim at targets from far away.
- **Observation**: Monitor other players from afar using screens.
- **Spell Casting**: Select and cast spells or buffs from a menu.

Each gadget corresponds to a specific skill, adding layers of strategy and complexity to the game. This approach allows for a division of labor among players, where everyone doesn't have to do everything within the same challenge.

## 4. Skill Gates

A unique concept being introduced in this game is "skill gates". These are checkpoints where players must demonstrate a specific skill they've learned to progress. This serves as a test of their understanding and mastery of the skills they've acquired throughout the game.

## 5. Level Design

As the level designer, it's crucial to ensure that players are adequately prepared for each challenge they face. For instance, before encountering a boss that requires parrying, the player should have been taught this skill during their journey leading up to the boss. This ensures a fair and balanced gaming experience, where success is determined by skill and understanding rather than luck.
