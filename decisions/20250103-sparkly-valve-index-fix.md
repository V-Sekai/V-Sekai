# Accepted: Sparkly Valve Index Display Fix

## The Context

The Steam Valve Index is still a reliable and robust head-mounted display for virtual reality. We should try to use it for as long as possible.

## The Problem Statement

A few weeks back, I started to get white and blue sparkling pixels on dark scenes.

[PSA: If you have sparkling pixels recently, there is a fix!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/oxd6xa/psa_if_you_have_sparkling_pixels_recently_there/)

## The Proposal

Enable DisplayPort training mode - compatibility mode A or B (B worked for me).

## The Benefits

The display sparkles are gone.

## The Downsides

A few moments of testing time with SteamVR.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative compatibility modes were considered but ultimately not pursued.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This fix specifically addresses users experiencing sparkling pixels on dark scenes.

## In Core and Done by Us

The V-Sekai development team implemented the DisplayPort training mode adjustment.
