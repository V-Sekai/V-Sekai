I want to bake blendshapes\n   * 52 face blendshape face movements\n   * VRM blend shapes\n   * The blend shapes are interpolated between 0s and 1s.\n   * single animation track.\n3. I can send it to dem bones and bake the blend shapes.\n\n### Dem Bones baking procedure\n\n2. Remove empties that are unused.\n4. Extract the blend shape from the mesh\n5. Export as alembic 1 meter is 1 unit\n9. Remove the skeleton and fbx export as 1 meter is 0.01 units.\n10. Run dem bones (parameters to be determined)\n\n```bash\n./dembones -i=\"a.fbx\" -a=\"a.abc\" -z=4 --bindUpdate=2 -b=200 -o=\"a_res.fbx\"\n# Note RMSE should be in the same range\n# Iter #0: Updating trans..... Done! Updating weights... Done! RMSE = 0.00027808\n`\n\n11. Check the RMSE is less than 0.001.\n\n#### Options\n\nSkinning decomposition to generate bone transformations and skinning weights from input meshes sequence\n\n`call DemBones -i=\"Bone_Geom.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" -b=20 -o=\"Decomposition_20.fbx\"`\n\nJoint grouping \n\n`call DemBones -i=\"Bone_Geom.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" -b=20 --bindUpdate=2 -o=\"Decomposition_20_grouped.fbx\"`\n\nSolve skinning weights from input meshes sequence and input bone transformations\n\n`call DemBones -i=\"Bone_Trans.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" --nTransIters=0 -o=\"SolvedWeights.fbx\"`\n\nSolve bone transformations from input meshes sequence and input skinning weights\n\n`call DemBones -i=\"Bone_Skin.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" --nWeightsIters=0 -o=\"SolvedTransformations.fbx\"`\n\nOptimize given bone transformations and skinning weights from input meshes sequence\n\n`call DemBones -i=\"Bone_All.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" --bindUpdate=1 -o=\"Optimized.fbx\"`\n\nOnly solve helper bones using demLock attribute of the joints\n\n`call DemBones -i=\"Bone_Helpers.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" --bindUpdate=1 -o=\"SolvedHelpers.fbx\"`\n\nPartially solve skinning weights using per-vertex color attribute of the mesh\n\n`call DemBones -i=\"Bone_PartiallySkinned.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" --nTransIters=0 -o=\"SolvedPartialWeights.fbx\"`\n\n### Open questions:\n\nI align each track to a second? one after the others? \n\nHow do I find the tracks again?\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Better performance\n- Able to compose animations\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- More bones\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Status quo\n- Rejection Reason: Blend shapes are slow and uncomposable.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a few lines of code to do error bound matching and geometry processing.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI know how to do this! \n\n## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->\n\n- https://github.com/electronicarts/dem-bones\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
