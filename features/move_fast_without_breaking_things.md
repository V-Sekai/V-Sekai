# Move fast without breaking things

## Prototyping Quickly

1. Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
2. Prioritize tasks based on their importance and dependencies.
3. Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) with essential features.
4. Iterate and improve upon the MVP based on user feedback and testing.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

1. Set up a version control system (e.g., Git).
2. Configure a build system to compile and test your code automatically.
3. Use a continuous integration (CI) service (e.g., Github actions, GoCD) to run tests on every commit.
4. Deploy your application using a continuous deployment (CD) service to ensure it's always up-to-date.

## Documenting Decisions

1. We store our project's documentation at [V-Sekai Manuals](https://v-sekai.github.io/manuals/).
2. Record design decisions, architecture choices, and any changes made during development.
3. Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves.
4. Encourage team members to contribute to the documentation and review each other's work.
