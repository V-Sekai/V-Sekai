There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass\n> method referred to as Shortcut.\n\n> The main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can\n> be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX\n> 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in\n> the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused). TressFX 4.1/Cauldron uses both Shortcut and PPLL.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nAvatars are a strength of V-Sekai.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nCode complexity.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nReduz isn't interested in OIT.\n\n### References\n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/master/doc/TressFX4xDeveloperGuide.pdf\n- https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXPPLL.hlsl\n- https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXShortCut.hlsl\n- https://blog.icare3d.org/2010/07/opengl-40-abuffer-v20-linked-lists-of.html\n- https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/oit/oit.cpp\n-\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
