# Proposed: Enhancing Godot Engine’s 3D Pipeline through Open-Source Collaboration

## Metadata

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Deciders:** V-Sekai, fire
- **Tags:** V-Sekai, Godot Engine, FBX Importer, Open-Source, Collaboration

## The Backdrop

V-Sekai is an open-source collective focused on improving [Godot Engine's](https://godotengine.org/) 3D and animation capabilities. The community is founded on strong principles of inclusivity, sharing knowledge, and fostering a friendly environment for all contributors.

## The Challenge

The collective aims to enhance the Godot Engine's 3D pipeline, addressing the need for a robust workflow that can efficiently integrate [USD](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) and Maya within a Blender-to-Godot environment, improve asset storage, automate conversions, manage CDN distributions, and develop a specialized Godot Engine Launcher.

## The Strategy

To collaborate with [AYON](https://ayon.ynput.io/), drawing on their expertise to bolster the Godot Engine's pipeline. This partnership will focus on developing strategies and tools that align with the collective’s vision and the broader needs of the game development community.

## The Upside

The collaboration with AYON could accelerate the development of an optimized pipeline, leading to increased efficiency, better asset management, and a more intuitive experience for artists and developers alike.

## The Downside

This initiative may encounter challenges in integrating feedback from a broad user base and balancing the technical direction with the varied needs of community members.

## The Road Not Taken

Without AYON's collaboration, V-Sekai might continue to rely on a less optimized pipeline, potentially slowing innovation and the integration of new technologies within the Godot Engine community.

## The Infrequent Use Case

The partnership will aim to create flexible pipeline solutions that not only cater to common use cases but also accommodate less frequent, specialized workflows, ensuring a broad applicability.

## In Core and Done by Us?

While the initiative is core to V-Sekai's mission, the partnership with AYON will bring in external expertise to complement the in-house capabilities, fostering a balanced approach to pipeline development.

## Letter

I'm with V-Sekai, where we work with the Godot Engine, focusing on enhancing 3D formats and animations through open-source collaboration. Our group is built on the principles of community, friendliness, and shared knowledge.

We've put together a promising alpha-level Godot FBX importer, thanks to our community-driven approach. While formal testing isn't our forte, we're lucky to have a broad user base willing to test and provide feedback, which is vital for refining a game engine pipeline.

We're reaching out to learn from AYON's expertise in a few specific areas:

- **USD & Maya Integration:** Strategies to integrate USD and Maya within a Blender-to-Godot workflow.
- **Asset Storage Solutions:** Viable alternatives to mainstream asset storage systems.
- **Automated Conversion Services:** Tools for validating and converting source formats to Godot's native formats (.tscn, .scn, .res, .tres).
- **CDN Management:** Techniques to differentiate between production and development CDNs to streamline asset and code management.
- **Godot Engine Launcher:** Assistance in creating an automated custom launcher for the Godot Engine, aiding studios in managing updates and projects for their custom engine changes.

We're excited about the possibility of collaborating to build a pipeline that serves the game development community and keeps up with industry needs.
