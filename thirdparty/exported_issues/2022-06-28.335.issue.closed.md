### Request description

1 . first step: change the update_vsekai_godot script to push to a staging branch.
1. next step (lazy and simple): it is your responsibility to build the engine, run groups project and make sure it works.
1. optionally: you should perform an export build and make sure that works too.

1. next step (less lazy): we add another set of CI pipelines for staging godot -> staging templates -> staging groups
and then we test that
1. most issues aren't export related, so I think engine build + open project and run project is probably sufficient for most things
and we need a script to push staging -> groups-4.x
1. which means everyone gets the upgraded engine
