## The Backdrop

We are developing a VR game that needs to be compatible with both iPads and large projector screens for presentations. The challenge is to ensure the game's user interface and controls work seamlessly across these different display sizes and touch interfaces. The virtual joystick is intended to be a fallback of VR.

## The Challenge

Develop a virtual joystick designed specifically for touchscreens, focusing on compatibility with iPads and large projector screen presentations. This joystick will also be optimized for 3D applications, providing an intuitive user interface for navigating 3D spaces. It will come with various options to make it versatile for different applications.

## The Strategy

The implementation of this solution would involve designing and coding the virtual joystick, testing it on different devices and screen sizes, and iterating based on feedback and test results.

## The Upside

- Improved user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Increased versatility of the game, making it suitable for various applications.
- Enhanced navigation in 3D spaces.

## The Downside

- Potential increase in development time and costs.
- Possible need for additional resources for testing on different devices and screens.

## The Road Not Taken

This section can be used to document any alternative solutions that were considered but ultimately rejected.

## The Infrequent Use Case

If this enhancement will be used infrequently, it might be possible to work around it with a few lines of script. However, this depends on the specific requirements of the game and how often players will be using iPads or presentation screens. If these are common scenarios, then a dedicated solution like the proposed virtual joystick would be beneficial.

## The Core Reason

Ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes is a fundamental aspect of game development. Therefore, it makes sense for this to be a core part of our development process. This is why we should undertake this task ourselves.
