## Context and Problem Statement

Fill a 4m wide x 4m deep x 5m tall space with an Aquarium Nightclub theme.

## Proposed Solution

Design an immersive environment that combines elements of an aquarium and a nightclub. The booth should include aquatic-themed decorations, lighting, interactive elements, and a hostess to engage visitors.

### Key Features

1. **Aquatic-themed decorations**: Use 3D models of marine life, such as fish, corals, and seaweed, to create a realistic underwater environment.
2. **Dynamic lighting**: Implement the ambiance of a nightclub.
3. **Interactive elements**: Add interactive components, such as touch-sensitive screens or motion sensors, to allow visitors to interact with the marine life and control the lighting effects.
4. **A Mesmerizing Jellyfish Hostess**: Our enchanting jellyfish girl **JellyBell** welcomes visitors with a warm embrace and offers a comprehensive introduction to the booth. As a knowledgeable hostess, she is well-versed in all aspects of the products and services showcased at the booth. Guiding guests through the booth, JellyBell ensures that no crucial details or captivating demonstrations are overlooked. Her almost transparent skin bestows upon her an ethereal and otherworldly presence. The intricate **bioluminescent patterns** adorning her body captivate onlookers as they glow and shift colors, creating a hypnotic visual experience. Emulating the tendrils of a jellyfish, delicate ribbons trail behind her, further enhancing her aquatic allure.
5. **Ambient music**: Include background music that complements the aquarium and nightclub themes.

## Implementation

1. Design and model the 3D assets for the marine life, corals, seaweed, and hostess.
2. Implement the interactive elements using appropriate input devices and programming.
3. Add a hostess character into the booth.
4. Integrate the ambient music into the environment.

## Positive Consequences

- Attracts visitors with its unique and engaging theme.
- Provides an immersive experience that combines education and entertainment.
- Encourages interaction and exploration within the virtual environment.
- The hostess adds a personal touch and enhances visitor engagement.

## Negative Consequences

- May require significant development time and resources to create high-quality 3D assets, implement interactive features, and develop the hostess AI.
- Could be challenging to balance the two themes (aquarium and nightclub) without one overpowering the other.
- Integrating dynamic lighting and shaders with an existing environment may require additional effort and customization.

## Option Graveyard

- Creating a simple static environment without interactive elements.
- Focusing solely on either the aquarium or nightclub theme.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, this enhancement requires significant design and development work to create an immersive and interactive environment.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Yes, creating a unique and engaging booth for the virtual market exhibition is essential for attracting visitors and showcasing our capabilities in virtual reality development.
