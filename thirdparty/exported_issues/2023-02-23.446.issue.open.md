### Context and Problem Statement

Uro is still hard to deploy with cockroachdb.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Provide a sqlite path for uro deployment.

- [ ] Rollup postgresql migrations
- [ ] Migrate to sqlite

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Use a sqlite schema.

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

We can trial mvsqlite.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: Doing nothing
- Why: Cockroachdb is still a bit hard to deploy

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a backend service.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We want to make it easier to deploy URO.
