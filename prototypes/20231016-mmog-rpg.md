# VR MMOG Project Design

## 1. Introduction

The project at hand is a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Game (VR MMOG). The primary focus of this game is to provide an immersive co-op experience, where players can team up with friends to tackle challenges in a dungeon-style setting. A key feature of this game will be the integration of voice chat and custom avatars, enhancing player immersion and individuality.

## 2. Player Experience

The goal is to create a game that encourages teamwork and moments of co-op improvisation. Players will work together using their unique abilities to overcome each challenge. The key feelings that the player will experience are cooperation, strategy, and triumph over shared obstacles. Voice chat will facilitate real-time communication, fostering a sense of camaraderie among players. Custom avatars will allow players to express their individuality and feel truly immersed in the game world.

## 3. Emphasis on Gadget Mechanics

Instead of having distinct classes, players will have access to various gadgets that enable them to perform a wide range of actions:

- **Object Manipulation**: Move objects around by blocking or pushing them.
- **Long-Range Targeting**: Aim at targets from far away.
- **Observation**: Monitor other players from afar using screens.
- **Spell Casting**: Select and cast spells or buffs from a menu.

Each gadget corresponds to a specific skill, adding layers of strategy and complexity to the game. This approach allows for a division of labor among players, where everyone doesn't have to do everything within the same challenge. The emphasis here is on the mechanics of using these gadgets, creating a feeling similar to how Nier Automata's fighting feels.

## 4. Skill Gates

A unique concept being introduced in this game is "skill gates". These are checkpoints where players must demonstrate a specific skill they've learned to progress. This serves as a test of their understanding and mastery of the skills they've acquired throughout the game.

## 5. Level Design

As the level designer, it's crucial to ensure that players are adequately prepared for each challenge they face. For instance, before encountering a boss that requires parrying, the player should have been taught this skill during their journey leading up to the boss. This ensures a fair and balanced gaming experience, where success is determined by skill and understanding rather than luck.

## 6. Custom Avatars and Voice Chat

To enhance the immersive experience, players will be able to create custom avatars. This feature allows players to express their individuality and feel more connected to their in-game character. Additionally, the game will support voice chat functionality, enabling real-time communication between players. This not only facilitates strategic planning but also promotes social interaction within the game environment.

## 7. Teamwork Over Solo Play

While the game may draw comparisons to Batman due to its gadget-based mechanics, the emphasis here is on teamwork rather than solo play. The greatest successes in this game are achieved as a squad, and we want players to experience that sense of camaraderie and shared triumph.
