## Draft: Single-Stack Prototyping Approach for V-Sekai

### The Context

Prototyping is essential for validation and iterating within the V-Sekai development ecosystem.

This proposal recommends a single-stack approach centered around the Godot Engine, augmented by Elixir and Phoenix for cloud functionalities.

### The Problem Statement

Even within a single-stack approach using technologies like Godot and Elixir, over-specialization can hinder prototyping. Developers may gravitate towards their areas of expertise, which can lead to imbalances and challenges when building features that span both client-side and server-side domains.

For example, consider developing a avatar system.

A developer might excel at GDScript for client-side tasks like animation and rendering, while feeling less confident handling Elixir for server-side components like avatar customization and data persistence. This can lead to:

- **Gaps:** Developers might have a deep understanding of one aspect of the system but a limited understanding of the other, making it difficult to grasp the feature as a whole.
- **Silos:** A tendency to stay within their comfort zones can prevent developers from gaining experience across the full spectrum of development, potentially hindering their growth and the project's flexibility.
- **Dis-integration:** While Godot and Elixir can work together seamlessly, bridging the gap between client-side and server-side logic still requires careful consideration and can become a bottleneck if developers are not comfortable working across both domains.

A more holistic approach, where developers are encouraged to work across different aspects of a feature, can mitigate these issues. This fosters a broader skillset, a more comprehensive understanding of the system, and a smoother integration process.

### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

This proposal envisions a prototyping ecosystem where Godot is the foundation, integrated with Elixir and Phoenix:

```bash
mix igniter.new --with phx.new --install ash,ash_postgres,ash_phoenix,ash_authentication,ash_authentication_phoenix,ash_admin
mix ash_authentication.add_strategy magic_link
mix ash.codegen initial
mix ecto.create
mix ash.setup
```

This setup provides a foundation for prototyping by automating the configuration of common components like authentication and databases.

This approach allows developers to focus on Godot while incorporating Elixir and Phoenix for cloud needs within a consistent environment.

### The Benefits

- **Flexibility:** Godot, Elixir, and Phoenix provide a wide range of tools for prototyping diverse applications, from games and VR/AR experiences to web-based tools with cloud functionalities.
- **Consistency:** Centering on Godot promotes consistency in code style and development practices, facilitating knowledge sharing and reducing onboarding time for new developers.
- **Efficiency:** This approach streamlines development, reducing the overhead of managing multiple technologies and leading to faster prototyping cycles.
- **Developer Empowerment:** A unified toolset empowers developers to explore new possibilities and contribute more effectively to the project.

### Addressing Potential Concerns

Focusing solely on the Godot, Elixir, and Phoenix ecosystem for prototyping ensures a streamlined and efficient workflow. By leveraging the strengths of these technologies, we can address a wide range of prototyping needs within a consistent environment. This approach encourages developers to become proficient in both client-side and server-side development, fostering a more versatile and capable team.

### The Road Not Taken

Alternative approaches, such as a multi-stack approach or relying solely on Godot without cloud capabilities, were considered.

- **Multi-stack approach:** While offering flexibility in tool choice, this introduces complexities and inefficiencies. Managing multiple languages, frameworks, and deployment processes can significantly increase overhead.

- **Godot-only approach:** Relying solely on Godot limits the ability to prototype features that require server-side logic or cloud functionalities, such as user accounts, persistent data storage, and online interactions.

These alternatives were deemed less efficient and less aligned with the goals of streamlining development and fostering consistency.
