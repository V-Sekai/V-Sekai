# 4. Gadget Mechanics

The game does away with distinct classes, instead offering players access to various gadgets that enable a wide range of actions:

- **Object Manipulation**: Move objects around by blocking or pushing them.
- **Long-Range Targeting**: Aim at targets from far away.
- **Spell Casting**: Select and cast spells or buffs from a menu.
- **Grid Interaction**: Utilize a grid interaction system where you can pinch to zoom in and out, allowing for examination and exploration of the game world.

Each gadget corresponds to a specific skill, adding layers of strategy and complexity to the game.
