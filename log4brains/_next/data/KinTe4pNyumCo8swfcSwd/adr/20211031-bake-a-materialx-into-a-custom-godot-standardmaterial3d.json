Not simple.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\nExpansion into a web tool.\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI found an approach and it can be done.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/fire/MaterialX/tree/gltf\n- https://godotengine.org/showcase/material-maker\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_texture\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
