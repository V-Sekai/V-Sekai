I want to bake blendshapes\n   * 52 face blendshape face movements\n   * VRM blend shapes\n   * The blend shapes are interpolated between 0s and 1s.\n   * single animation track.\n3. I can send it to dem bones and bake the blend shapes.\n\n### Dem Bones baking procedure\n\n2. Remove empties that are unused.\n3. Merge all meshes into one mesh (current limitation)\n4. Merge all animations into one animation and save a json of the frame and animation split times.\n5. Export one animation as an alembic sequence\n6. Export better-fbx with a meter to centimeter conversion and no animations. Set unit scale to 100. Export only deform bones.\n7. Import better-fbx with only deform bones.\n8. Export better-fbx again.\n9. Set BONE_COUNT to be 3x the bone count.\n10. Run dem bones (parameters to be determined)\n    * `dembones -i=\"Bone_Geom.fbx\" -a=\"Bone_Anim.abc\" --bindUpdate=2 -b=BONE_COUNT -o=\"Decomposition_$BONE_COUNT.fbx\"`\n11. Check the RMSE is between 0.1 and 0.\n11. Use the resulting fbx scale is changed from cm to meters.\n\n### Open questions:\n\nI align each track to a second? one after the others? \n\nHow do I find the tracks again?\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Better performance\n- Able to compose animations\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- More bones\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Status quo\n- Rejection Reason: Blend shapes are slow and uncomposable.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a few lines of code to do error bound matching and geometry processing.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI know how to do this! \n\n## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->\n\n- https://github.com/electronicarts/dem-bones\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
