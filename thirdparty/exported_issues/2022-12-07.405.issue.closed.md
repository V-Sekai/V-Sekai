### Context and Problem Statement

We want to pass metadata like the copyright and versions of V-Sekai that are compatible for browser filtering.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Add xmp json (gltf) to Godot Engine

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. add xmp json-ld support
2. ???

### Positive Consequences

We can filter on this in search.

### Negative Consequences

Json-ld has unknown complexity.

### Option graveyard

Do nothin?

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Json sounds easy but may not be a few lines of code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

It may be useful. I don't know.
