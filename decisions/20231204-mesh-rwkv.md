## Background

MeshGPT uses a transformer model trained on geometric vocabulary to generate triangle meshes, resulting in clean, coherent, and compact meshes.

## Problem

The challenge is adapting GPT-like generative models for the 3D domain. Automated triangle mesh generation needs a robust solution.

## Strategy

The MeshRWKV model implementation is a sequence-based approach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. The conversion process to RWKV4 can be broken down into two main steps:

## Step 1: Learning a Vocabulary for Triangle Meshes

The first step involves learning a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes from a large collection of 3D object meshes. This allows triangles to be encoded to and decoded from this embedding.

A graph convolution encoder is employed, operating on triangles of a mesh and their neighborhood to extract geometrically rich features that capture the intricate details of 3D shapes. These features are quantized as embeddings of a codebook using residual quantization, effectively reducing sequence lengths of the mesh representation.

These embeddings are sequenced and then decoded by a 1D ResNet guided by a reconstruction loss. This phase lays the groundwork for the subsequent training of the transformer.

## Step 2: Autoregressive Mesh Generation

The next step is to train RWKV4, which leverages these quantized geometric embeddings. Given a sequence of geometric embeddings extracted from the triangles of a mesh, the transformer is trained to predict the codebook index of the next embedding in the sequence.

Once trained, the transformer can be auto-regressively sampled to predict sequences of embeddings. These embeddings can then be decoded to generate novel and diverse mesh structures that display efficient, irregular triangulations similar to human-crafted meshes.

### Key Terms

- **Encoder-Decoder Network:** A type of artificial neural network designed to convert inputs into a set of features, and then decode those features to produce a new output.
- **Residual Quantization:** A technique used to reduce the sequence lengths of the mesh representation.

- **1D ResNet:** A type of convolutional neural network that is used to decode the sequenced embeddings.

- **RWKV4:** A robust and efficient model architecture called Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) that we're using to train our MeshRWKV model for Elixir.

- **MeshRWKV:** The model we're proposing. It's specifically trained for Elixir using RWKV4 and uses an encoder-decoder network with vector quantization to generate triangle meshes from a learned vocabulary.

- **Autoregressive Model:** A type of statistical model used for time series data. In our case, we're using it to generate a mesh based on the sequence of words from our learned vocabulary.

- **Elixir:** A functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). We're training our MeshRWKV model specifically for this language.

- **Triangle Meshes:** A type of polygon mesh commonly used in 3D computer graphics. They're composed entirely of triangular facets. Our model is designed to generate these meshes from a learned vocabulary.

- **Geometric Embeddings:** These are representations of triangles in a high-dimensional space that capture their geometric properties.

- **Graph Convolution Encoder:** This is a type of neural network architecture designed to operate on graph-structured data.

- **Auto-regressive Sampling:** A method of generating new data points based on previously generated ones.

## Benefits

Our approach produces compact meshes with sharp geometric details. It can suggest multiple shape completions for incomplete shapes.

## Drawbacks

Training the model may require significant computational resources. Learning a vocabulary for triangle meshes could be complex.

## Alternatives

Other methods like neural field-based approaches exist but often miss geometric details or produce over-triangulated meshes.

## Special Use Case

Generating complex 3D shapes for niche applications might need additional model training or fine-tuning.
