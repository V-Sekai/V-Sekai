# Avatar Customization with AI-Generated Facial Expressions

## Overview

This proposal aims to enhance avatar customization in V-Sekai by incorporating AI-generated facial expressions, providing users the ability to create more realistic and diverse avatars with ease.

## Context and Problem Statement

Customization of avatars' facial expressions within V-Sekai is somewhat limited, restricting users from fully realizing the potential of their virtual characters. There lacks a streamlined process that allows for the creation of nuanced and emotionally rich expressions vital for immersive interactions.

## Proposed Solution

The integration of an AI-based system capable of generating a wide array of realistic facial expressions can significantly augment the current limitations faced by V-Sekai users. Below outlines the components and mechanisms of the proposed solution:

### Components

1. **AI Model Training**: An extensive collection of facial expression data will be used to train machine learning models specializing in emotion recognition and generation.
2. **Expression Generation Interface**: Users will interact with a simple interface to specify desired emotions and modifiers which the AI model will use to output unique facial expressions.
3. **Animation System Integration**: The generated expressions will be formatted compatibly with the VRCFT's Unified Expressions animation systems, ensuring smooth integration and ease of use.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Realism**: Avatars will possess the capacity to display genuinely convincing emotions.
- **Diversity in Expression**: A wider range of emotional responses increases the depth of social interactions.
- **User Experience**: Simplifies the expression creation process, making avatar personalization more accessible.

## Decision Makers

- V-Sekai development team and community stakeholders.

## VRCFaceTracking (VRCFT)

VRCFaceTracking (VRCFT) serves as a platform facilitating eye and face tracking data integration. The introduction of Unified Expressions standardizes the face shapes and expressions usable across various avatars, enhancing compatibility and user experience. The platform also allows developers to leverage an SDK for external tracking modules, enabling broader support for face tracking technologies. With this groundwork laid out, there is potential to push the boundaries of avatar expressiveness further using AI.
