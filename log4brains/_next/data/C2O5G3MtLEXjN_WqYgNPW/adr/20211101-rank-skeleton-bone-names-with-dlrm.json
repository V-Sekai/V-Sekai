Install dlrm.\n2. Generate training data.\n3. Mapping to bone names, attributes and categories.\n1. Use a training app create test data.\n4. Generate train and test datasets for T-Posed character surfaces\n   1. Is the bone mapping correct?\n   2. features\n      1. Bone X global location in meters\n      2. Bone Y global location in meters\n      3. Bone Z global location in meters\n      4. Bone truncated normalized basis axis x 0\n      5. Bone truncated normalized basis axis x 1\n      6. Bone truncated normalized basis axis x 2\n      7. Bone truncated normalized basis axis y 0\n      8. Bone truncated normalized basis axis y 1\n      9. Bone truncated normalized basis axis y 2\n      10. Bone X global scale in meters\n      11. Bone Y global scale in meters\n      12. Bone Z global scale in meters\n      13. Body mass in kilograms\n      14. Feminine vs masculine unit-less\n      15. Head circumference in meters\n      16. Neckline circumference in meters\n      17. Left Shoulder circumference in meters\n      18. Right Shoulder circumference in meters\n      19. Left Elbow circumference in meters\n      20. Right Elbow circumference in meters\n      21. Left wrist circumference in meters\n      22. Right wrist circumference in meters\n      23. Waist circumference in meters\n      24. Left thigh circumference in meters\n      25. Right thigh circumference in meters\n      26. Left ankle circumference in meters\n      27. Right ankle circumference in meters\n   3. categorical features\n      1. Corresponding VRM Bone\n         1. ???\n         2. None\n   4. A missing value means the field is empty.\n5. Train.\n6. Test.\n7. Use on cpu and in Godot Engine.\n   1. Probability of a click.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n* We can guess the proper name.\n* Useful for the facial mapping problem?\n* Useful for the character generator slider recommendation problem?\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n* Starring at the abyss.\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n* Option:\n  + bpr from Quora\n* Rejection Reason:\n  + Bpr from Quora is not used in production.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a few lines of code.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need this to make the quality of life of creators better.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n* https://github.com/facebookresearch/dlrm\n* https://medium.com/@marthawhite_81346/learning-with-the-criteo-tb-dataset-e3ec12d9d77e\n* https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge/data\n* Skeleton pool operator from neural blend shapes.\n* https://tailor.fandom.com/wiki/Types_of_measurement\n* https://knarkowicz.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/octahedron-normal-vector-encoding/\n    \n\n```\n    @article{li2021learning,\n    author = {Li, Peizhuo and Aberman, Kfir and Hanocka, Rana and Liu, Libin and Sorkine-Hornung, Olga and Chen, Baoquan},\n    title = {Learning Skeletal Articulations with Neural Blend Shapes},\n    journal = {ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)},\n    volume = {40},\n    number = {4},\n    pages = {1},\n    year = {2021},\n    publisher = {ACM}\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, \nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
