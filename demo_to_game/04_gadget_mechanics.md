In this game, the traditional concept of distinct classes is replaced with a more flexible and dynamic system - the gadget mechanics. This innovative feature provides players with access to various gadgets, each enabling a wide range of actions that add depth and complexity to gameplay.

One such gadget allows for **Object Manipulation**. With it, players can move objects around within the game environment, either by blocking or pushing them. This opens up new possibilities for puzzle-solving and strategic planning.

Another gadget focuses on **Long-Range Targeting**. This enables players to aim at targets from far away, adding an element of precision and tactical decision-making to combat situations.

The game also includes a gadget for **Spell Casting**. Players can select and cast spells or buffs from a menu, allowing for a variety of magical strategies during encounters.

Lastly, there's a gadget designed for **Grid Interaction**. This unique tool lets players utilize a grid interaction system where they can pinch to zoom in and out. This feature enhances examination and exploration of the game world, making every corner of the map a potential discovery.
