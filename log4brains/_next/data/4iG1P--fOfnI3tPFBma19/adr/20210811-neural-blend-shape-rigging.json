Similar to the smpl_std.\n\n#### Get neural Blend shapes\n\nClone neural blend shapes\n\n`git clone https://github.com/PeizhuoLi/neural-blend-shapes.git`\n\n#### Blender\n\n1. Open your base mesh\n2. Open the smpl_std.obj into the Blender mesh\n3. Enable the mesh align Blender addon\n4. Select the rest of the meshes and then the smpl_std mesh\n5. Align base_mesh.obj to the base mesh and then translate it so it stands on the floor\n   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32321/125210550-4bfe8100-e255-11eb-9bc3-cbc7bfe4b98e.png)\n\n#### Neural Blend Shapes\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-x86_64.sh\nsh Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-x86_64.sh\nmamba create --name neural python=3.7\nmamba activate neural\nmamba install tensorboard tqdm PyTorch torchvision torchaudio -c PyTorch -y\npython demo.py --pose_file=./eval_constant/sequences/house-dance.npy --obj_path=./eval_constant/meshes/ALPAPAAM.obj --normalize=1 --animated_bvh=1 --obj_output=0\nsudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo\nsudo flatpak install org.blender.Blender\ncd blender_scripts\nflatpak run org.blender.Blender -b -P `pwd`/nbs_fbx_output.py -- --input `pwd`/../demo --output `pwd`/../demo/output.fbx\n```\n\n#### Use voxel diffuse skinning\n\n1. The skeleton model above weighted the eye area. This is not good.\n2. Use https://www.blendermarket.com/products/voxel-heat-diffuse-skinning\n3. Take skeleton from output.fbx and reweight it onto the original mesh set\n\n#### VRM\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32321/125210653-0b533780-e256-11eb-8758-caeca92a16e2.png)\n\n1. Set bone mappings\n2. In the scripting set first person json to use bone \"22\" for the head\n3. TODO Move the skeleton so it stands on the floor\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot workaround-able.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\nNo finger support yet.\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nMixamo is a black box and V-Sekai would be more robust to have an alternative.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/PeizhuoLi/neural-blend-shapes\n- Skeleton https://github.com/Xananax/ALPAPATAM\n- Mannequin https://github.com/V-Sekai/blue-tin-fox-models/actions\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
