# Proposed: Multiplayer Sync Between Different Godot Instances

## What is the context of the proposal?

We aim to enhance multiplayer capabilities in the Godot Engine by synchronizing node scene trees across different instances. We never RPC; instead, we only sync property data and do network events. Additionally, we intend to create a shadow scene tree to generate asynchronous glTF 2.0 binaries served via a web server.

## What is the problem being solved?

Currently, synchronizing complex node scene trees in multiplayer scenarios within Godot is challenging. There's a need for an efficient method to ensure consistency across all client instances. Moreover, generating async glTF 2.0 binaries for web servers requires a reliable shadow scene tree mechanism.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams.

The proposal involves implementing a synchronization protocol that mirrors the node scene tree structure across all multiplayer instances. This includes:

- **Syncing Node Trees:** Establishing real-time updates, property synchronization, and state management to ensure all clients reflect the same scene tree.

  ```gdscript
  func sync_scene_tree(node):
          for child in node.get_children():
                  update_network_properties(child)
                  sync_scene_tree(child)
  ```

- **Shadow Scene Tree:** Creating a duplicate of the main scene tree to handle asynchronous operations like glTF 2.0 binary generation.

  ```gdscript
  var shadow_tree = duplicate_scene_tree(main_tree)

  func generate_async_gltf():
          Thread.new().start(shadow_tree.export_gltf())
  ```

- **Web Server Integration:** Serving the generated glTF binaries through a web server for external access.

## What are the benefits of the proposal?

This proposal ensures consistency by providing all multiplayer clients with a synchronized view of the scene. Performance is enhanced by offloading heavy operations to a shadow tree, preventing main thread blockages. Scalability is facilitated through reliable synchronization of multiplayer environments. Flexibility is achieved by enabling asynchronous processing and external access to generated assets via a web server.

## What are the downsides of the proposal?

There is increased complexity from implementing synchronization protocols and shadow trees. Resource consumption may rise due to maintaining shadow trees and processing synchronous operations. Latency issues might occur with high-frequency updates.

## What are the alternative proposals?

- Server-side authority: Centralizing scene management on the server to control synchronization.
- State interpolation: Managing discrepancies through interpolation techniques.
- Decentralized synchronization: Allowing clients to manage their own logic without a central protocol.

## When might the proposed solution be used rarely or not at all?

In single-player environments or where scene complexity is minimal, the synchronization overhead might be unnecessary. Projects not requiring asset exports would not benefit from the shadow scene tree approach.

## Is this a V-Sekai core responsibility, and should it be done by us?

Yes, managing multiplayer synchronization and asset generation aligns with V-Sekai's focus on enhancing social VR functionalities within the Godot Engine ecosystem.
