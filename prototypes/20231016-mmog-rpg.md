# VR MMOG Project Design

## 1. Introduction

The project at hand is a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Game (VR MMOG). This is an ambitious and exciting venture that will require significant focus and dedication over the coming weeks. The game will be immersive, interactive, and offer a unique gaming experience to players.

## 2. Player Classes

Players will have the option to choose from 3-4 distinct classes. Each class will come equipped with its own set of unique gadgets that aid in performing specific actions related to that class. This adds variety and depth to gameplay, allowing players to choose a playstyle that best suits them.

## 3. Class Gadgets

The gadgets provided to each class enable players to perform a wide range of actions:

- **Object Manipulation**: Players can move objects around by blocking or pushing them.
- **Long-Range Targeting**: Players can aim at targets from far away.
- **Surveillance**: Using screens, players can monitor other players from afar.
- **Spell Casting**: From a menu, players can select and cast spells or buffs.

These gadgets add layers of strategy and complexity to the game, enhancing player engagement.

## 4. Skill Gates

A unique concept being introduced in this game is "skill gates". These are checkpoints where players must demonstrate a specific skill they've learned to progress. This serves as a test of their understanding and mastery of the skills they've acquired throughout the game.

## 5. Level Design

As the level designer, it's crucial to ensure that players are adequately prepared for each challenge they face. For instance, before encountering a boss that requires parrying, the player should have been taught this skill during their journey leading up to the boss. This ensures a fair and balanced gaming experience, where success is determined by skill and understanding rather than luck.
