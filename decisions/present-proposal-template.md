## Proposal Style

Maintaining a consistent and professional style is crucial in proposal writing. However, the output often needs more stylistic quality when AI assists in this process.

We often need better style and consistent formatting when we instruct AI to help complete our proposals.

1. **Avoid Purple Speech**: Use clear and concise language, avoiding overly elaborate or flowery expressions.

2. **Be Snappy**: Keep sentences short and concise to maintain reader engagement.

3. **Avoid Coded Phrases**: Refrain from using coded phrases like "effective altruism" since altruism inherently implies effectiveness and not the opposite.

4. **Keep Consistent Headers**: Please be sure to adhere to the header structure provided in the template to ensure consistency across documents.

5. **Avoid Bolded Headers** Do not recommend bolding headers due to noise.
