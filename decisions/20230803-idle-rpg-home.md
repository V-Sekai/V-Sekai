# Make an Idle RPG World

## Metadata

- Status: Proposed 
- Deciders: V-Sekai
- Tags: V-Sekai

## Context and Problem Statement

We aim to provide a compelling reason for users to stay engaged in the V-Sekai world. An idle RPG game could be the solution, offering continuous gameplay that encourages prolonged interaction.

## Proposed Solution

### Setting

1. A well made sharp and cozy place.
1. Static couch collider: A fixed location where players can interact or rest.
2. Static bed without collider: A place for characters to rejuvenate without any physical interaction.
3. Mirror that is off: A decorative element that can be turned on for various uses.
4. Video player screen that is off: A feature that can be activated for entertainment or information.

### Story

1. Chill and hang with friends: The game will provide a relaxed environment where players can socialize.
2. Play a game: Beyond socializing, players can engage in an idle RPG game for fun and rewards.

### Systems

1. RPG idle game with fake cash chests: Players can earn fake currency through continuous play, even when they are not actively engaged.
2. Settings are not persisted past server restart

## Implementation

The implementation details will be decided upon acceptance of this proposal.

## Positive Consequences

- Increased user engagement
- Prolonged interaction within the V-Sekai world
- Enhanced socialization among players

## Negative Consequences

- Potential increase in development time and resources
- Risk of unbalanced gameplay if the idle RPG system is not properly designed

## Option Graveyard

This section will be filled as we explore different options and discard those that are not feasible or effective.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

The frequency of use will depend on the players' engagement level. However, given the complexity of an idle RPG system, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Creating an idle RPG system as a feature of V-Sekai will enhance the overall user experience and engagement, which aligns with our goal of providing a compelling virtual world.
