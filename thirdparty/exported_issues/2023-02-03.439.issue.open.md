### Metadata

- Status: rejected <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

Downloading is slow in V-Sekai.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

To make downloads go faster we can use compressed http chunks.


### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

I'd expect our server to already be using Content-Encoding
for CDN, it's not going to help because our files should already be zstd compressed

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: This proposal. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: Packed scenes are zstd compressed.<!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Knowing what to do is hard.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature.
