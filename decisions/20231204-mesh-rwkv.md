## Background

MeshGPT uses a transformer model trained on geometric vocabulary to generate triangle meshes, resulting in clean, coherent, and compact meshes.

## Problem

The challenge is adapting GPT-like generative models for the 3D domain. Automated triangle mesh generation needs a robust solution.

## Strategy

Our strategy revolves around the creation of a model called MeshRWKV. This model will be specifically trained for Elixir using RWKV4. The process involves two main steps:

1. **Learning a Vocabulary for Triangle Meshes:** The first step is to learn a vocabulary that can accurately represent triangle meshes. This vocabulary will serve as the foundation for our mesh generation.

2. **Autoregressive Mesh Generation:** Once we have our vocabulary, we use it for autoregressive generation of a mesh. This process is carried out by an encoder-decoder network. This network features vector quantization at its bottleneck, which allows us to maintain the compactness and coherence of the generated meshes.

After the training phase, our model will be capable of directly sampling meshes as sequences from this vocabulary. This means that given a sequence of words from our vocabulary, the model can generate a corresponding mesh.

### Glossary of Existing Terms

1. **Encoder-Decoder Network:** This is a type of artificial neural network designed to convert inputs into a set of features, and then decode those features to produce a new output. It's often used in machine translation and image recognition tasks.

2. **Vector Quantization (VQ):** This is a technique often used in lossy data compression. In the context of our model, VQ is used at the bottleneck of the encoder-decoder network to maintain the compactness and coherence of the generated meshes.

3. **RWKV4:** This is a robust and efficient model architecture called Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) that we're using to train our MeshRWKV model for Elixir.

4. **MeshRWKV:** This is the model we're proposing. It's specifically trained for Elixir using RWKV4 and uses an encoder-decoder network with vector quantization to generate triangle meshes from a learned vocabulary.

5. **Autoregressive Model:** This is a type of statistical model used for time series data. In our case, we're using it to generate a mesh based on the sequence of words from our learned vocabulary.

6. **Elixir:** This is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). We're training our MeshRWKV model specifically for this language.

7. **Triangle Meshes:** These are a type of polygon mesh commonly used in 3D computer graphics. They're composed entirely of triangular facets. Our model is designed to generate these meshes from a learned vocabulary.

## Benefits

Our approach produces compact meshes with sharp geometric details. It can suggest multiple shape completions for incomplete shapes.

## Drawbacks

Training the model may require significant computational resources. Learning a vocabulary for triangle meshes could be complex.

## Alternatives

Other methods like neural field-based approaches exist but often miss geometric details or produce over-triangulated meshes.

## Special Use Case

Generating complex 3D shapes for niche applications might need additional model training or fine-tuning.
