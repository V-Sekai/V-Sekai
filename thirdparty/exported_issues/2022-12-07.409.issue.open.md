### Context and Problem Statement

Leverage caching logic to keep everything in sync between clients

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

1. Caching layer provides a good user experience even if the host player's internet sucks.
2. All changes eventually get written back to the host player's hard drive,
3. V-Sekai boots up on the local machine and serves the project up to a caching solution.
4. We lock files when they're being edited
5. Delete objects
6. Edit objects
7. Persist the world on close


### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

???

### Positive Consequences

### Negative Consequences

### Option graveyard

_No response_

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Nope

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is the core of V-Sekai in my humble opinion.
