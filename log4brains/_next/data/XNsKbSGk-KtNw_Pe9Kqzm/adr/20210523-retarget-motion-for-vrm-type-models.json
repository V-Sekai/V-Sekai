In the Animation section, enable the following options\n    - [x] Scale FPS\n    - [x] Scene Duration\n- use the Pose Transfer tab (vertical tab part of the \"N\" options panel?)\n    - Source: the imported BVH armature\n    - Target: the imported avatar armature\n    - Click the Rebuild Bone List\n        - manually map over any bones not automatically mapped\n        - eg: LeftLowerArm => \"Left elbow\"\n        - note: it is possible to save your mapping to .json and reuse\n    - Click Retarget Animation\n        - retargeting may take several minutes\n- verify retargeting by playing the animation via the Blender play button\n- Export the scene as a .glb (using default settings)\n\n### Common Problems\n\nQ: retargeted animation seems to have legs crossed / backwards\n\nA: This can happen if you import a VRM avatar as a .gltf (re-import using the VRM importer add-on)\n\nQ: legs/arms bend unnaturally \n\nA: check the armature bone name mappings\n  - at most, each target bone name should appear once\n  - leave BVH joints not present in your avatar blank\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n**Thanks to humbletim for being the scribe**\n\n**Thanks to lyuma for being test pilot flying these steps**\n\n### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Have a generally robust process of retargeting motions to VRM-type models.\n\n### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Only VRM\n- MMD does not work.\n\n## Option graveyard: Adobe Mixamo\n\nList the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)\n\n* Propietary Online Service\n* Blackbox technology\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nMotion retargeting is not trivial offline or online.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need motions for our character controller without using an off-the-shelf black box solution.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://www.blender.org/\n- https://hackmd.io/EmOAt375S8KFqaNdPDJCXQ\n"},"creationDate":"2021-05-24T02:06:27.000Z","lastEditDate":"2021-05-25T22:18:35.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"K.
