### Context and Problem Statement

We need content to be able to export to OMI

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We need to be able to import Mozilla hubs to Blender to be able to export to OMI

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

* Modify https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-blender-exporter to be able to import
* Add import button
* Parse MOZ_hubs_components
* Import "spawn-point"

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines

### Positive Consequences

Bidirectional import is import for exchanging glbs.

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Can collaborate with Mozilla Hubs Blender team.
