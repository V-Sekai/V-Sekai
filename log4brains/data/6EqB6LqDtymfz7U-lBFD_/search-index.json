This will be necessary for python multiprocessing in containers, specifically usage of shm_lock, which is used by Emscripten.\n\n#### dev-shm.te\n\n```\nmodule dev-shm 1.0;\n\nrequire {\n        type container_runtime_tmpfs_t;\n        type container_t;\n        class dir { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename link search rmdir remove_name reparent add_name open };\n        class file { map getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link execute_no_trans entrypoint execmod open };\n        class shm { write destroy unix_write getattr create read setattr unix_read associate lock };\n        class sock_file { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link open };\n        class fifo_file { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link open };\n        class lnk_file { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link };\n}\n#============= container_t ==============\nallow container_t container_runtime_tmpfs_t:dir { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename link search rmdir remove_name reparent add_name open };\n# domain_can_mmap_files\nallow container_t container_runtime_tmpfs_t:file { map getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link execute_no_trans entrypoint execmod open };\nallow container_t container_runtime_tmpfs_t:shm { write destroy unix_write getattr create read setattr unix_read associate lock };\nallow container_t container_runtime_tmpfs_t:sock_file { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link open };\nallow container_t container_runtime_tmpfs_t:fifo_file { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link open };\nallow container_t container_runtime_tmpfs_t:lnk_file { getattr relabelto unlink ioctl execute append read setattr write lock create rename relabelfrom link };\n```\n\nNow, install it with:\n\n```bash\ncheckmodule -M -m dev-shm.te -o dev-shm.mod\nsemodule_package -m dev-shm.mod -o dev-shm.pp\nsudo semodule -i dev-shm.pp\n```\n\n### Install k3s (Start here if recreating)\n\n```bash\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb --disable=flannel --disable=cni '--kubelet-arg=eviction-soft=memory.available<0%,imagefs.available<0%,nodefs.available<0%' '--kubelet-arg=eviction-hard=memory.available<0%,imagefs.available<0%,nodefs.available<0%'\n\n```\n\nNow you will need to obtain the DNS IAM credentials. In this example, we are working with these Route53 hosted domains: vsekai.org,vsekai.net,vsekai.com,vsekai.cloud,v-sekai.org,v-sekai.net,v-sekai.com,v-sekai.cloud,vsek.ai,v-sek.ai\n\nInstall Helm services:\n\n```bash\nACCESSKEY=AKIAABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP\nSECRETKEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nsudo helm repo add gocd https://gocd.github.io/helm-chart\nsudo helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx\nsudo helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami\nsudo helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io\nsudo helm repo update\n\n# We are still using 3.2.3 - I have not figured out the upgrade process yet for external-dns\n\nsudo helm install external-dns --set provider=aws --set aws.zoneType=public --set registry=noop --set aws.credentials.accessKey=\"$ACCESSKEY\" --set domainFilters='{vsekai.org,vsekai.net,vsekai.com,vsekai.cloud,v-sekai.org,v-sekai.net,v-sekai.com,v-sekai.cloud,vsek.ai,v-sek.ai}' --set aws.credentials.secretKey=\"$SECRETKEY\"  bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n# NOTE: Some of these commands may be outdated:\n# They seem to refer to nginx-nginx-ingress but now it is nginx-ingress-nginx.\n# Take the following with a grain of salt:\n\nsudo kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx\nsudo helm install --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo kubectl patch svc/nginx-nginx-ingress-controller -n kube-system --patch '{\"spec\":{\"externalTrafficPolicy\":\"Local\"}}'\nsudo kubectl patch deployments/nginx-nginx-ingress-controller --patch '{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"spec\":{\"hostNetwork\":true}}}}' -n kube-system\n\nsudo kubectl get replicasets -n kube-system\n# Find the oldest nginx-nginx-ingress-controller one and delete with\nsudo kubectl delete replicasets -nginx-ingress-controller-abcdefg-whatever -n kube-system\n\n\n# Some weird stuff we changed.

I sometimes do it that way.\n# Delete the old Agents on the web interface. Wait for the new agents to come up, and enable them and assign them as appropriate.\n```\n\n#### DockerHub\n\nCreate DockerHub permissions: Create an account if you do not have one. Visit https://hub.docker.com/settings/security and create an Access Token. Copy the token.\n\n```bash\nsudo  kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=dockerhubuser --docker-password=XXXX --docker-email=your.dockerhub.email@example.com\n```\n\n#### OSXCROSS\n\nFor osxcross (OSX cross compiling), make sure the OSX compiler SDK *you created on mac* os located at /opt/osxcross.\n\nIf you do not have osxcross (no access to Apple hardware), then you must create an empty directory at /opt/osxcross or remove the relevant volume mounts (and remove from enabled build targets in the gocd pipelines).\n\nNow create Docker-in-Docker, and apply this file with `kubectl create -f dind.yaml` or `kubectl apply -f dind.yaml`\n\n#### dind.yaml\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: gocd\n    component: agent-dind\n  name: gocd-agent-dind\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  progressDeadlineSeconds: 600\n  replicas: 2\n  revisionHistoryLimit: 10\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: gocd\n      component: agent-dind\n      release: gocd\n  strategy:\n    rollingUpdate:\n      maxSurge: 25%\n      maxUnavailable: 25%\n    type: RollingUpdate\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      creationTimestamp: null\n      labels:\n        app: gocd\n        component: agent-dind\n        release: gocd\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - env:\n        - name: GO_SERVER_URL\n          value: http://gocd-server:8153/go\n        image: gocd/gocd-agent-docker-dind:v21.2.0\n        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n        name: gocd-agent-dind\n        resources: {}\n        securityContext:\n          privileged: true\n        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log\n        terminationMessagePolicy: File\n        volumeMounts:\n        - mountPath: /root/.ssh\n          name: ssh-secrets\n          readOnly: true\n        - mountPath: /root/.docker\n          name: kaniko-secret\n        - mountPath: /opt/osxcross\n          name: opt-osxcross-volume\n          readOnly: true\n      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst\n      restartPolicy: Always\n      schedulerName: default-scheduler\n      securityContext:\n        fsGroup: 0\n        runAsGroup: 0\n        runAsUser: 0\n      serviceAccount: default\n      serviceAccountName: default\n      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30\n      volumes:\n      - name: ssh-secrets\n        secret:\n          defaultMode: 256\n          secretName: gocd-ssh\n      - name: kaniko-secret\n        secret:\n          secretName: regcred\n          items:\n            - key: .dockerconfigjson\n              path: config.json\n      - name: opt-osxcross-volume\n        hostPath:\n          path: /opt/osxcross\n          type: Directory\n```\n\n### OSXCROSS GOCD Agents\n\nTo add osxcross support to the main agents, create the following patch:\n\ngocd-agent-patch.yaml\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: gocd-agent\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: gocd-agent\n        volumeMounts:\n        - mountPath: /opt/osxcross\n          name: opt-osxcross-volume\n          readOnly: true\n      volumes:\n      - name: opt-osxcross-volume\n        hostPath:\n          path: /opt/osxcross\n          type: Directory\n```\n\nand apply with:\n```bash\nsudo kubectl patch deployments/gocd-agent -p \"$(cat gocd-agent-patch.yaml)\"\n```\n\nMake sure to enable the Agents when they come up on the GoCD Dashboard. Add every server to the \"`developement`\" environment. Also, assign linux servers to \"`mingw`\" and \"`linux`\". Assign the dind agents to \"`dind`\".\n\n\nFor GitLab, go to https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/go/admin/security/auth_configs and select `Create new authorization configuration` -> `gitlab-auth-config` / `GitLab Authentication plugin` / follow documentation here: https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gitlab-oauth-authorization-plugin/blob/master/INSTALL.md - **Do not check Allow only known users to login yet**. If this works, you can skip the text auth step and corresponding passwd commands.\n\nCreate Guest login:\n\n1. Go to auth_configs, `Create new authorization configuration` -> `guest-login` / `Guest Login Plugin` / Fill out Go server URL / Username `view` / Display name `Guest`.\n2. Now, go to Roles Management. Create role `guest`. Add Deny for all types and Resources `*` as desired.\n3. In an Incognito window, visit the CI system and login as Guest.

Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node).\nNote: Interaction between nodes *within* a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\n\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\n\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all.\nAlso, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System's interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G.\nBy building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\n**Todo**: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\n\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n### A. Spawning\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection.\nPlayers and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n### B. Consistent References\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID.\n**Todo**: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n### C. State Synchronization\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced.\nThe network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting.\nEvents can be used to provide forced updates.\nGuarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\n\n**Entity properties:**\n\n- State that is synced is properties.\n- Some properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\n- Some properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:  \n\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization: \n\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:  \n\nWhen to use reliable events vs. \"unreliable\" (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n### D. Standard Interaction Protocols\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist?\nExamples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n### E. Network Security Model:\n\n**Concepts:**\n\n**Ownership:**\n\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.  \nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\n\n**Mastership:**\n\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.  \n\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.  \n\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)  \nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player \"takes\" their props with them.)\n\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?  \n\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.  \n\nExample: Team Melee\n\n### F. Inter-entity Isolation\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.  \nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n### G. Abstraction\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity's functions.\n\n### H. Physics\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be *attached* to the entity in specific ways.  \nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n### Spawn Type (i). Map builtins\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.  \nFor example, a button/door; or a state \"god object\"; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n### Spawn Type (ii). Map spawns\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.  \nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.  \nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n### Spawn Type (iii). Avatar spawns\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.  \nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n### Notes about Entity parenting:\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed.\nParenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\n\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (`queue_free()`) or removed from the scene tree (`remove_child()`); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n## Positive Consequences List <!-- optional -->\n\n* Possibility of:\n  * vehicle games\n  * bow and arrow games\n  * pickup of balls\n\n## Negative Consequences List <!-- optional -->\n  \n* Complexity\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\nAldridge, David. \"I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach\".

It details an AI framework and production pipeline that allow designers to craft huge amount of AI archetypes quickly and flexibly. Next, Genshin's pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\n* Emotional Systemic Facial of 'Last of Us Part II'\nAs graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\n* Motion Matching in 'The Last of Us Part II'\nNaughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\n* https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\n* https://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\n* https://baserow.io/\n* https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\n* https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
