Branch off Godot 3.4\n1. Use our version of wasgo\n1. Restore wasgo demos.\n1. Implement templated C++ code via mustashe for Wasgo\n1. Port to master\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Separate the two axis of development. The first axis is Godot Engine master and the second axis is Wasgo development.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- May or may not be more expensive.\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->\n- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nCoding strategy is not coding.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is a V-Sekai strategy plan.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://github.com/V-Sekai/WasGo\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
