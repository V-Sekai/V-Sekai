Convert the ENet module to use WebRTC\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Works in Opengl Godot 4\n- Works on the web with webrtc\n- Can disable 3D for size.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]\n\n[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->\n- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a few lines of gdscript.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is core.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- [Link type](link to decision) <!-- example: Refined by [xxx](yyyymmdd-xxx.md) -->\n- <!-- numbers of links can vary -->\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
