### Context and Problem Statement

I want to have a starting place for testing ai algorithms.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Create a Godot Engine C++ module with ncnn.

Provide test cases of:

1. image to string
2. string to image

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Compile ncnn into godot engine as a c++ module.

1. input_count
2. input/0/data (TypedArray)
3. output_count
4. output/0/data (TypedArray)

### Positive Consequences

Have a playground for testing.

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Option graveyard

Don't use onnx because it doesn't have vulkan support which limits reach.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a small number of gdscript lines.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I know how, and no one else is doing it.

Todo:

1. train a image of digits to label
2. save as a onnx runtime
3. execute via ncnn
4. ???
5. Digits recognized
