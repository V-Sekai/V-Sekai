### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

We want to provide user scripting.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We want to be able to co simulate scripts across multiple clients without arbitrary remote code execution.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

???

### Positive Consequences

We can add interactivity to V-Sekai.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This adding the ability to use code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Usability is a core feature.
