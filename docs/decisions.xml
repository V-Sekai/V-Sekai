<p>Improve the 3D import functionality in Godot Engine for V-Sekai by enhancing the existing import process and adding support for more file formats.</p>

<section id="context-and-problem-statement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>V-Sekai has implemented <code>.fbx</code> and <code>.gltf</code> 3D import, and <code>.obj</code> is already part of Godot Engine. However, there is still room for improvement in the import process and support for additional file formats. The current Blender importer for Godot Engine 4.0 requires an additional installation and injects a Python script into Blender.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Develop an addon that can simultaneously export colliders, occluders, and LOD variants for a given mesh without requiring an additional Blender importer.</li>
<li>Enhance the existing import process by providing better error handling, reporting, and automatic fixes for common issues.</li>
<li>Improve the performance of the import process, especially for large and complex 3D models.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create an addon that automatically searches for and sets Geometry Nodes input constants with relevant names (e.g., <code>is_occluder</code>, <code>is_collider</code>, and <code>LOD</code>) while exporting, giving modelers maximum flexibility on how different versions of a mesh should be exported. This addon should not require an additional Blender importer or Python script injection.</li>
<li>Update the import pipeline to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback to users.</li>
<li>Optimize the import process by implementing caching, parallel processing, and other performance improvements.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="positive-consequences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-consequences">Positive Consequences</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Users will have more control over the export process, allowing them to easily manage colliders, occluders, and LOD variants without needing an additional Blender importer.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-and-problem-statement">Context and Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Our project involves a distributed simulation system where maintaining strong consistency and efficient workload distribution are important requirements. We are currently facing the challenge of how to handle authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers without incurring high network hop counts and latency.</p>
<p>Someone invited me to a popular VR platform and gave me a 20-minute tour, just enough to learn how to in desktop mode create a world, import an object, and inspector-edit it. So I imported our celebration map, and the map loaded in 20 seconds. I was able to change its transform. I’m still thinking about that experience.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describe-the-proposed-option-and-how-it-helps-to-overcome-the-problem-or-limitation">Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation</h3>
<p>We propose to use a metadata system with Khepri instances and Raft consensus algorithm to manage ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes. Homeservers will manage metadata using their own Khepri instances within a Raft cluster, while simulation servers, including player simulation servers, will maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.</p>
<p>Authority transfer will be initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure will be updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates will be exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.</p>
<p>By monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers, we can balance the system and ensure fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers will ensure efficient workload distribution and enhance the overall gaming experience.</p>
<p>We believe that this approach will provide strong consistency guarantees, access control, and scalability while minimizing network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-a-scalable-distributed-simulation-system-with-khepri-instances-and-raft-consensus-algorithm">Building a Scalable Distributed Simulation System with Khepri Instances and Raft Consensus Algorithm</h4>
<p>In a distributed simulation system, maintaining separate roles for homeservers and simulation servers and using a metadata system with strong consistency guarantees is crucial. Homeservers are responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes, using a Khepri instance within a Raft cluster. Simulation servers, including player simulation servers, maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.</p>
<p>Authority transfer is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure is updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.</p>
<p>Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers allows for balancing the system and ensuring fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers ensures efficient workload distribution and enhances the overall gaming experience.</p>

<p>Sending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server may not be necessary, as the authority request can be sent directly to Player B’s homeserver without waiting for confirmation.</p>
<p>Total hops: 3 + 2 * H</p>
<p>Case 2: Authority transfer if Player A’s and Player B’s homeservers are exactly the same</p>

<p>Total hops: 3</p>
<p>In this optimized process, we have removed sending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server. This acknowledgment may not be necessary, as the response can be sent directly to Player B’s simulation server without waiting for confirmation. By removing this step, we reduce the total hop count by 1, potentially improving the efficiency of the authority transfer process when both players are on the same home server.</p>
<p>Case 3: Direct communication between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers on the same home server.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this modified version of Case 3, both the update and acknowledgment steps employ the high-performance communication system’s features. This includes using hand-optimized binary layouts for data transfer and asynchronous communication techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. The total hop count remains the same at 2 hops.</p>

<section id="negative-consequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Complexity</strong>: The proposed system involves multiple components, such as homeservers, simulation servers, Khepri instances, and Raft clusters. Managing and maintaining these components can be complex and may require significant development effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: The use of Raft consensus algorithm ensures strong consistency but may introduce performance overhead due to the need for communication between nodes in the cluster. This could impact the overall performance of the distributed simulation system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: While the proposal aims to provide scalability, it is not clear how well the system will scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows. Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong>: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fault tolerance</strong>: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system’s resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synchronization</strong>: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer. However, it does not provide details on how this synchronization process works, which could be a critical aspect of the system’s functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Load balancing</strong>: Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers is essential for balancing the system. However, the proposal does not provide specific details on how load balancing will be achieved or what metrics will be used to determine when to add or remove servers from the system.</p></li>

<p>We use different kinds of names for V-Sekai, such as <code>v-sekai</code>, <code>V-Sekai</code>, <code>vsk</code>, and <code>v_sekai</code>. It is confusing to find a scheme that fits the various naming conventions. Hyphens are banned in Godot Engine file systems, but allowed in GitHub branch names. We also use the <code>godot_addon</code> convention sometimes. How can we document and unify the naming conventions across different platforms and contexts?</p>

<ul>
<li>GitHub is case-insensitive: this can result in users or devs inadvertently typing the wrong case in one case</li>
<li>Windows is case-insensitive, so the above mistake can go unnoticed until the addon is used on a different OS</li>

<li><strong>Generate cage mesh</strong>: Generate a simplified “cage” mesh around the avatar base mesh using the Simplicage add-on. This cage will be used to help apply the garment to the avatar.</li>
<li><strong>Attach garment to cage</strong>: Attach the garment model to the cage created in the previous step, so that it follows the cage’s movement and deformation.</li>
<li><strong>Conform garment to avatar</strong>: Utilize the Mesh Materializer add-on to conform the garment model to the avatar base mesh, using a UV texture map to guide the wrapping process. This ensures the garment fits correctly on the avatar.</li>

<p>Integrate the Intermediate Representation Execution Environment (IREE) into the Godot Engine 4.0 as a C++ GDExtension. Utilize the Vulkan backend to run an image superresolution demo that generates 4x larger images. IREE is an MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR, allowing for better performance and scaling.</p>

  end</code></pre>
<p>The discussion involves the development of V-Sekai, a project with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. In the short term, the focus is on avatar loading, simple demos, VRM &amp; Unity import, network code reconciliation, adding network interpolation, and voice jitter buffer. Mid-term goals include working on the network, entity system, background loading, UI improvements, and developing a lightweight relay instance server. Finally, long-term goals involve scalable instances, network topology implementation, streamlined content creation, zero stutter loading, enhancing social and upload features, video and music playback and live streaming, scripting integrations, UX work for non-technical users, and in-editor content building UX.</p>
<p>One challenge the project faces is maintaining and improving the existing codebase, which includes outdated workarounds from Godot 3. Another setback was the change from OpenVR to OpenXR. Content is another hurdle: transferring a world from other platforms to V-Sekai is currently best accomplished by exporting source assets such as glTF or FBX. The project aims to cater to non-technical users, making it more accessible than other platforms. WASM-based scripting is being considered, but there are concerns about implementation challenges and security.</p>
<p>In addition, the V-Sekai project needs a project manager, and the team struggles to find collaborators who share their vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute significantly. Nevertheless, despite the long list of features needed for basic functionality, the team believes that V-Sekai is essential for the future of the Metaverse space, and that will draw collaborators to assist on our common vision.</p>
<p>It’s important that our roadmap and goals continue to be discussed and iterated on. Nothing should be seen as final, since technology changes so rapidly and consensus is important.</p>

<p>The V-Sekai project has an extensive roadmap with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals, but it lacks a project manager and struggles to find collaborators who share the vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute. How can we improve the collaboration process and attract more contributors to work on the project more effectively?</p>

<p>The proposed option to overcome the limitation of attracting more contributors and improving collaboration is to develop clear and concise project documentation, including a visual roadmap using mermaid.js, and establish a transparent contribution process. This will provide a structured environment for new and existing contributors to collaborate and understand the project’s goals and priorities.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<p>There are some potential downsides to packaging the Godot Engine for pkgin, which include:</p>
<p>Additional maintenance work: Supporting pkgin may necessitate regular package updates to ensure compatibility with different systems and to keep up with new Godot Engine versions and features. This could require extra time and resources from the development team.</p>
<p>Incomplete platform support: Pkgin is designed for UNIX-like systems, but it doesn’t directly cater to users on other platforms, such as Windows. Supporting alternative package managers for non-UNIX platforms may demand extra efforts.</p>
<p>User learning curve: Users unfamiliar with pkgin or pkgsrc might need to invest time in learning to use the package manager effectively, which could pose a barrier for some users, particularly those new to UNIX-like systems or with limited package management experience.</p>
<p>Potential compatibility challenges: While pkgin aims to provide compatibility across various UNIX-like systems, certain configurations or system setups may still pose difficulties. Addressing these issues might require more development and troubleshooting efforts.</p>
<p>Unnecessary overhead for small projects: For smaller projects or users with minimal requirements, the added features and capabilities provided by pkgin support might be excessive. In such cases, the effort needed to maintain and use a pkgin package could outweigh its benefits.</p>
<p>Despite these potential downsides, offering pkgin support can bring significant advantages, such as streamlining installation and updates, ensuring compatibility with UNIX-like systems, and promoting collaboration within the open-source community.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-graveyard">Option graveyard</h3>
<p>Alternative package managers: While other package managers like apt or yum might have been considered, they may need to provide different compatibility with BSD-type systems than pkgsrc. Pkgin, designed for pkgsrc, is the default package manager for systems like NetBSD and SmartOS, making it the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Manual installation: Requiring users to compile and install Godot Engine manually would complicate the process and be less user-friendly, particularly for novices. This approach could also result in software version inconsistencies and configuration issues, affecting user experience.</p>
<p>Custom package manager: Developing a custom package manager specifically for V-Sekai’s platform is resource-intensive and duplicates existing package managers’ efforts, such as pkgin, which already offers compatibility with BSD-type systems.</p>
<p>Exclusively focusing on other platforms: By targeting only Linux, macOS, or Windows, V-Sekai would limit its potential user base and overlook the advantages of supporting UNIX-like systems like NetBSD and SmartOS. So instead, packaging Godot Engine for pkgin enables V-Sekai to reach a wider audience using BSD-type operating systems.</p>
