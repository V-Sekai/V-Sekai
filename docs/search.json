    "text": "V-Sekai is a social virtual reality platform that is free and open source, meaning that anyone can use it to make their own games or social experiences.\nInterested in V-Sekai or #GodotVR development? Join the V-Sekai discord server!\nV-Sekai means virtual world in Japanese.\n\n\nSocial vr is a huge scope and we piggyback on hundreds of Godot Engine contributors.\nThere has already been over 100+ V-Sekai PRs merged into Godot Engine core.\n\n\n\n\nThe group meets ad-hoc in Discord discord.gg/7BQDHesck8.\nWeb: v-sekai.org\nTwitter: twitter.com/VSekaiOfficial\nGithub: github.com/V-Sekai\nWe track our proposals with our V-Sekai.github.io Issues\nWe organize our issues using V-Sekai-game issues which makes it easier to track progress based on desired outcomes and objectives.\nWe discuss our efforts on Discord.\nAny questions? Contact the designated group lead(s) saracenone, lyuma or fire.\n\nOur Commitments:\n\nRecurring meeting is at ad-hoc\nOur working agreement is this page.\nWe do not have a group retrospective every month to reflect on what is going well, what could be improved, and what we will do differently next cycle.\nWe will not be recording our meetings.\nWe will create an agenda before our recurring meetings, and take notes during our meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking to make complete documentation for the developers and users.\nWe have a list of features we need to cover already.\nWrite as efficiently as possible to immediately create all the draft pages, one for each significant feature or topic we need to cover. Every prominent feature requires at least an introduction, so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.\nOn each page, we want to create a bullet list of all the things the user needs to learn to use the feature.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a topic, for example, Godot XR. The user will need to know:\n\nWhat is XR (we can link to a page or briefly explain it)\nWhat is Godot (if we have covered it already on the previous page, link to that page, and briefly re-explain, e.g. in one sentence)\nHow XR works in Godot and how our product uses it\nWhat people can achieve concretely with that [feature/knowledge on this page]\nWhat are limitations of the technology [that also affect our product]\n\nEach page’s draft should be a bullet list like this. Because then we or the writer instantly knows all the points the page must cover And it doesn’t take very long to write and review those bullet lists\nLast, for all the cases where the user has to follow steps (for example, using an interface), we need to detail each step with the most straightforward words possible. For instance, if they need to click on three buttons, we describe the steps with explicit mentions of the labels as seen in the UI and always use the same verbs, for example:\n\n\n\nTo change the game’s resolution:\n\nOpen the Project -> Project Settings… menu.\nIn the left column, navigate down to Display -> Window. In the right part of the window, the game’s window settings appear.\nScroll down to the resolution setting.\nClick the numbers to change the resolution. The values are in pixels.\n\nWhen we say reusing the verbs, it’s about being consistent, like:\n\nClick a button\nOpen a menu\nOpen a file\nNavigate to a tab\n\nIt doesn’t have to be 100% of the time the same but for instance, for buttons, click and press are well understood, but “use,” while correct, maybe a bit harder to parse\nAlso, changing the phrasing, style, and verbs used throughout our docs adds cognitive load.\nMaking things simple, explicit, and consistently allows users to focus on the steps and memorize new information.\n\n\n\n\nThis page was written with advice from gdquest."

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" >> \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this. Copy the first two numbers from the CockroachDB CCL line. In this case, 20.2\n#\n# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.\n# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.\n# To exit, type: \\q.\n#\n# Server version: CockroachDB CCL v20.2.2 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nReplace some.version in the following command with the value we found above:\nSET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.preserve_downgrade_option = 'some.version';\nFinally, perform the upgrade:\nsudo kubectl delete job cockroachdb-init\nsudo helm upgrade cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl delete pods/cockroachdb-client-secure\nsudo kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge gains about service creation\nOperation experience\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant maintenance\n\n\n\n\n\nOption: Dedicated Servers\nOption: Virtual Machines\n\n\n\n\nYes, it is possible to deploy this system using docker or in the root system.\n\n\n\nHaving experience with kubernetes and maintaining discipline will make scaling or service upgrades smoother in the future.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://k3s.io/\n\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "Status: accepted\nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,lyuma,humbletim,codefloof,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nBuild Gltf extensions. Why build incomplete Gltf extensions with limited usefulness without the complete package? We should be making for creators, not ourselves.\n\n\n\nhumbletim, codefloof, iFire and lyuma debated the meaningfulness of building Gltf extensions.\niFire constructed an argument we are making a Gltf container for the metaverse. A metaverse container where each part is separated because of limited engineering bandwidth. We brought up the point Gltf isn’t unknown and is unknown.\nLyuma can’t entirely agree that Gltf extensions are “separated.” Gltf extensions are independent extensions that are good from an engineering perspective.\nLyuma reaffirmed his suspicions that OMI standards are not so valuable in isolation. Humbletim raised valid concerns that the Unity work had not progressed, and Mozilla Hubs had not merged the OMI audio emitter code. We may need Unity platforms and Mozilla Hubs to bootstrap the ecosystem, but tools like Gltf transform could sidestep it.\niFire also constructed a strawman of how operating inside a platform is seamless, and transferring between platforms is like pulling teeth. Still, a strawman isn’t something that helped facilitate the discussion so Lyuma may have misunderstood that part. iFire described the unity package vs others. Lyuma agrees that this is valid; other formats could be deemed “interoperable,” more expressive than Gltf.\nIn Lyuma’s mind, it’s a fair X point that already exists. So why work on Y? Why does Gltf 3d format if we have Fbx 3d format etc.?\nLyuma doesn’t think we need to assume that there must be only one standard.\nWe’re trying to see if we can do better by working together than taking some existing closed format and using it verbatim.\nOMI work is valid even if a unity package standard exists. We don’t need to be the only standard.\niFire didn’t exhaust all the details of the point, but we can make a Gltf transform for as many standards we can catalogue.\n\n\n\nWe will generate github actions templates using the same jsonnet we use for GoCD.\n\n\n\n\nInteroperating between platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to ignore users.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption: Keep the status quo, which is having separate platforms.\nRejection Reason: We want interoperability at OMI.\n\n\n\n\nIt is not only a few lines of code.\n\n\n\nWe want to maintain it to encourage developers and as the publisher of the platform it is our responsibility.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://omigroup.org/\n\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass method referred to as Shortcut.\n\n\nThe main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused).

    "text": "Status: draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai, Malek, Lyuma, SaracenOne, Fire,\nTags: Networking,\n\n\n\nWe seek to solve these issues:\n\n(A) Use godot 4.0’s networking tools.\n(B) Use a relay server that doesn’t run any game code, rather than a headless V-Sekai server.\n(C) Make the costs of hosting V-Sekai as small as possible.\n(D) Write the server in Rust, for the speed and safety guarantees.\n(E) Make networking highly scalable for a single server.\n(F) Allow a client to connect to multiple servers simultaneously without issues, for seamless travel and portals.\n(G) Synchronize state between clients\n\nNote: This proposal does not cover Permissions, and is based in part on the previous Entity Networking proposal.\n\n\n\nBy using the technologies described below, we will cover A-G.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce complexity, latency, and processing power, we have created a simple Mastership/Ownership model.\nClients are defined as individuals connecting to a Server, they have their own v-sekai game instance running.\nThe Relay Server, as of now, does not contain information about the state of the world, the only information the Relay Server contains is on Mastership/Ownership rules.\nP1 connects to the Server.\n\nP2 connects to the Server.\n\nP3 connects to the Server.\n\nP1 spawns in a Ball.\n\nServer marks that P1 has both Mastership and Ownership of Ball.\n\nServer synchronizes with P1 and sends the state of the Ball to P2, its location, rotation, the very fact of its existence, and its owner, master, and rule.\n\nServer State\n\n\n\nObjects\nMaster\nOwner\nRule\n\n\n\n\nBall\nP1\nP1\nAsk\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n\nSince P1 is the Owner of the Ball, this means that P1 is the only one who can change the state of the ball. When Server synchronizes, if P2 were to have the ball in a different location then P1, the Server would tell P2 that the Ball is in the location P1 has it, and would do the same for P3. It can be thought of as a mutex on the state of the Ball. Whoever holds the Mutex is the one who can modify the state therein. This also means that all calculations for game state are split up among all the players, every player only has to run code modifying what they own, which in large scale player events would otherwise increase exponentially with custom scripts for each player’s props or avatars.\n\n\n\nThis presents a problem however, how could P2 take the Ball from P1? The solution is Mastership. Whoever is the Master can change who is the Owner at any time. The Master also can change whatever the default Rule is, which is what the Server, and Client references when looking to change Ownership to itself (or someone else?).\n\nAsk: Take a round trip to the Master and back to the Server so the Master can decide based on external factors whether or not to allow ownership transfer or deny it. This could be used for example, if someone only wants a gun to be grabbable if they are a “shooter” and not if they are a “civilian”\nDeny: You cannot ask for ownership transfer, good for things like Avatar’s transform node, you don’t wanna be involuntarily moved around, or for the root of the world map.\nAllow: You can ask for ownership any time, and it is automatically granted.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the rate of synchronization based on the closest clients owned model, and other things like that, there are a lot of areas for optimization when it comes to using this.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Latency for Competitive/Real-Time interactions\nLow processing power on both the server and client side\nBroad enough to be easily modifiable for optimizations in the future without changing the model\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity, we will have to code this all from scratch basically\nMulti-user interactions become impossible on a single object, at least to do simply, some smart coding could get around it but it isn’t easy to do.\nResolutions for the allow rule could lead to inconsistencies, such as two different people picking up a gun and firing it, and two resulting bullets being spawned from the same gun before it gets removed from one individual.\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely, this is the foundation of basically everything content wise in V-sekai.\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/blob/master/decisions/2020/20200729-entity-networking.md\nMalek’s forum post on networking in the Discord server.\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "Merge retargeting feature into Godot Engine master\n\nDescribe the status of the issue.\nSuperceded by the https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/issues/229 proposal.\n\n\nList the deciders of the issue.\nV-Sekai,tokage,fire,lyuma\n\n\nDescribe the tags of the issue.\nV-Sekai,animation,retargeting,\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nWe want to share animations among different skeletons.\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nUse tokage’s animation retargeting.\n\nLyuma’s explanations\nFirst of all, Local (rest) and Absolute modes are not good enough for most of the common retargeting cases. As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the “silhouette” of the model.\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can’t say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz’s idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage’s diagram.\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you’re going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\nfrom what I can understand, “2” is what Tokage is proposing. I don’t see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don’t see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n\n\n158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee pull request.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nSharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nThe feature is hard to do.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

We may try prototyping this type of system in multiple ways.\n\n\n\nThis keeps low latency but reduces the needed bandwidth to sync 100,000 entites.\nNapkin math:\n50 bytes per frame per object * 100,000 objects = 5MB per frame.\n5MB/frame * 20 fps = 100MB = 1Gbps\nIf we send updates of all obejcts to all objects, that requires 100Tb/s\n\n> yea 100k users at once is impossible any way you put it. I think a realistic goal is 1k, as like, our max goal\n\nRight, so you would need to not send updates for far away objects\n\nOnly send 1000 closest objects: 1Tb/s \n\n+ Send faraway objects at 2Hz: 100Gb/s\n\n+ Heavy delta compression: 10Gb/s\n\nThis is for all players\n\nThie means, in a hypothetical universe where distant objects only need position sync, a server with 10Gb/s NIC could theoretically run 100,000 concurrent users, if optimizzed!\n\nAlso, therefore, per player bandwidth **of distant objects** would be 100Kbit/s of downstream data, which is pretty small.\n\nAgain I haven't accounted for IK synchronization, or for additional nearby objects, so it could be higher here.\nNearby objects is a smaller problem and easier to solve, and belongs in a separate proposal.\n\n\n\nWe may be overcomplicating a problem that doesn’t need to be solved yet. Pure interest management may be sufficient, and we do not currently have this many users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:\nDiscord VC with Malek and iFire\nDiscord channel forum-v-sekai “Networking with librg” thread: https://discord.com/channels/471446618156040210/1031379649776848900/1032401929587929208\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text": "Status: accepted\nDeciders: V-Sekai,Lyuma,SaracenOne\n\n\n\nFor Groups, this system aims to solve the following issues:\n\n(A) Need a way to standardize scene spawning.\n(B) Need a way to refer to nodes/instances that is consistent across clients (for example, “Set parent to …”).\n(C) Need a way to synchronize state between clients.\n(D) Provides a basic set of standard protocols and interactions.\n(E) Provides the basis for a security/privacy model regarding entity communication/permissions over the network.\n(F) Provides a security model locally for access between nodes of one entity and nodes of another entity (assuming a secure scripting framework is implemented).\n(G) This also solves the problem of abstracting away implementation details of entities; for example, there should be no need to deal with Godot nodes on an individual basis.\n(H) Provide a unified way to create top-level physics hierarchies isolated from other game logic.\n\nNote: This proposal covers three Spawn Types:\n\nSpawn type (i) Entities integrated into a map;\nSpawn type (ii) map entities spawned by clients; and\nSpawn type (iii) avatar entities/props spawned by clients.)\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in point (G), everything documented here relates to Scenes and Entities. Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n\n\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibility of:\n\nvehicle games\nbow and arrow games\npickup of balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\n\n\nA networking system is not a few lines of code.\n\n\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n\n\nAldridge, David. “I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach”.

It details an AI framework and production pipeline that allow designers to craft huge amount of AI archetypes quickly and flexibly. Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\nhttps://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\nhttps://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\nhttps://baserow.io/\nhttps://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

To propose something you have to have a fleshed out proposal.\nThat works well for Godot for two reasons: Godot has lots of users so there are already too many feature proposals; and the users of Godot are developers who can be asked to do research and write a whole implementation proposal\nThe users of V-Sekai are not technical in the same way; and furthermore we are not at the scale Godot was in 3.2 when they switched to requiring proposals.\nIf we ever do get big enough that feature requests propose a burden then we can consider making it harder to file them\n\n\n\nModify the V-Sekai-game issue templates to be easier to use.\n\n\n\nRemove required fields.

We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Currently probably the best way to learn Kaolin is to take a look through the documentation and look for relevant functions. We hope to make more demos which will make learning Kaolin smoother in the future.\nThe functions which will be useful to you would be:\nkaolin.io.obj.import_mesh to import a mesh.\ntorch.meshgrid to generate a bunch of 3D coordinates of a voxel grid.\nkaolin.metrics.trianglemesh.point_to_mesh_distance to get the distance function for those points.\nkaolin.ops.mesh.check_sign to get the sign of the points to multiply with the distance.\nkaolin.ops.conversions.voxelgrids_to_trianglemeshes to convert the SDF grid to a mesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n[e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …]\n\n\n\n\n\nMight require the GPU.\nInferencing may be difficult at interactive rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption: \nRejection Reason: \n\n\n\n\nCUDA, PyTorch and c++ are significant works.\n\n\n\nI have an approach!\n\n\n\n\nhttps://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html\nhttps://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?tag=qslim\n\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

There’s also a microsoft and a mozilla hub implementation for spatial audio node in wav?, mp3? or ogg? . He had unfinished business with the extension namespace of hubs and wanted to split it.\n2021-06-23 00:19:33Z lyuma: “https://github.com/V-Sekai-godot-hop-spin-dance Don’t get your hopes up quite yet: A lot of the lower level dependencies for scene packing and t-posing are not converted yet, but the tool scripts work now, so it’s a start :-p” 🔥 (1)\n2021-06-23 00:19:07Z lyuma: Worked with fire to get the avatar conversion tool updated, using the high level vsk_avatar vsk_vrm_avatar_tool modules: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/857052116593803284/unknown.png\n2021-06-22 23:48:06Z lyuma: mux says they also keep hitting this issue. they also made the connection to set_name() interestingly\n2021-06-22 23:47:51Z lyuma: after a day of debuggin, Saracen got a reproduction project here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/49843\n2021-06-22 23:22:17Z fire: Another day.

It was a badly ported coroutine calling a heavy function continually. Still some issues with pathfinding and abilities not executing, but it’s at least actually functioning now.\n2021-06-19 19:22:18Z Saracen: Further fixes, there’s workarounds now for the tool I wrote to extract root motion. Two of the notable bugs I’ve discovered are ConfigFile.load returning random values and the fact that there doesn’t seem to be implicit casting between String and StringName. Want to create some example projects for this. It’s also worth noting that while Amethyst is close to being functional now, it’s running OBSCENELY slow at the moment. 🦥 (1)\n2021-06-19 18:01:49Z Saracen: Some more progress on the Amethyst port\n2021-06-19 07:45:39Z fire: Can now export blends to gltf2 and save as an artifact.

    "text": "Moved issues into the tracker.\n\n\nWorked with manifold csg library author and was able to remove the boost dependency. https://github.com/elalish/manifold/pull/92\nAlso published a first draft on a Godot Engine master branch. See the issue for details.\n\n\n\nLyuma\nMade a lot of progress towards animation import in Unidot. Godot’s node system means that some paths become different: for example, meshes have to be reparented to skeletons; or extra levels in the hierarchy to keep track of physics bodies.\nTo this end, it is now keeping a lookup dictionary from path and component to fileID (which can be mapped to Godot node) which means animation support should be close.\n(Also, they made a major change to the import system in 2019 which affects id numbering. Still working on it)\nPushed a major update to Unidot, mostly in the post_import script. It should now generate paths much more accurately to the original file, and implemented the hashing algorithm used by Unity 2019 for file ID generation, for example generating ids like 919132149155446097 for the root object.\nThis has fixed some assets exported from Unity 2019 like below, which used to fail to resolve the fileIDs for meshes! @iFire\nMade some progress with terrain import in Unidot. It will import textures, normalmaps and splatmaps (creating an appropriate ShaderMaterial). My plan is to implement trees and grass using MultimeshInstance objects. With this I also now support texture assets. Texture Arrays seem to fail internally. Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn’t implemented on Godot’s end, but we’ll get there…\nperformance-wise, I think it’s now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I’m using tristrips so it’s mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development. (if you’re interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general)\nTerrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.\nI also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don’t understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I’d rather work on something else.\n\n\n\n\nRestore fix-save-as-binary so we can export projects\nRestore elixir shared branch so we can run godot in elixir\nPoked ludwig about diffusion net for machine learning training.\n\n\n\n\nFBX2GLTF and Blender importers are merged.\n\n\n\niFire\n\nMade a bug report for Blender exported animation to gltf with @RockyMadio https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/issues/1613 GitHub"

Make sure resources have been imported by opening the project in the editor at least once.\nNote that I was forced to rebase to the latest build which includes the new build system (target=editor) most of the code I changed is in the private gitlab repo. once things stabilize and we get the build system up and running again, next step is to publish the remainder of the code on github\n\ngroups-4.x (and staging) were updated to latest. I attempted to update GoCD, but it’s a bit of a yolo merge, since a few pieces all had to be updated at once due to new scons target=editor argument we need to follow https://ci.v-sekai.cloud/ (log in as guest) and test the release builds\n\n\nexport builds are being created again with the new scons naming scheme. They seem to work on linux (steam deck) at least. Don’t have access to a windows machine right now\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/v-sekai/v-sekai-game is released as fully opensource.\n\n\n\n\niFire (he, him) — Today at 16:33 https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-game/pull/5 added caching to reduce doing nothing builds from 2 hours to 10 minutes ish\n\nNew contributors this week:\n@Malek Awesome for being around 🐱. Contributed to designs and cheering us when we succeed. Fixed the issue with the ci/cd with the recurse submodules.

Please test, @トカゲ is looking for feedback.\ntefusion’s gdextension addon https://github.com/tefusion/godot-subdiv is now published. https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1488\niFire reorganized the development documentation site.\niFire is working on a bullet train kinetic novel https://github.com/V-Sekai-fire/INK_bullet_train world.\n\n\n\nUpdated this website to remove the left sidebar. Added headers to decisions and the changelog.\n\n\n\nGodot Engine proposal meeting rejected setting float=64 as default.

Detail building tools\nCloud Gardens, a relaxing level building game\nDreams\ncrocotile3d.com\nMinecraft\n\nAI-Assisted Level Generation will probably also be a thing soon\nDesigning fun player-interaction Concepts\n\nBetalars would like to work on it, but it is hard\n\nMaking pretty Characters\n\nBetalars has been working on a sims-style character generator\nCurrent state can be found on gitlab\n\nHopefully will also benefit Godot Engine community\n\n\nDeveloping a Tablet-Mode for V-Sekai\n\nThere has been effort put into creating a Non-VR interaction mode\nCurrently it is pretty janky and not thought through\nBetalars would like to improve this\n\nFire’s V-Sekai priorities:\n\na better setting to be in\ncommunications between at least two people\nbetter character motion via constraints, spring bones, and animations\nbetter character models (betalars has a character creation system that they already developed as possible collaboration points)\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub.com/omigroup/ux-research\nThis is the new repo for the recently formed UX Research group in OMI. Check back weekly for updates on this repo and how to get involved. - GitHub - omigroup/ux-research: This is a new working group for OMIGroup\n\n\n\n\nMmmaellon’s work requires him to build an XR app using AWS Services.

I think we’re going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.\n\nRadical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.\nAdd BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh.

You need to use Mobile Dragon Shop (very dark) or Tokyo Map\nNote that avatars are currently not working. I think I’m getting closer to identifying where the validation is causing trouble.\n\n\nWe are working on a v2 of the network architecture based on Godot’s network spawn & sync system, so a lot of the code I’m editing right now is kind of legacy at this point. The new network implementation should drastically simplify the code and eliminate dozens of complex GDScript files from being needed. I still want to get this demo stable, since we will still be using the player controller and avatar loader from it\n\n\n\nVSK Tokyo Map\n\n\nThe new v2 network demo can be found at https://github.com/V-Sekai/net_demo if you’re curious. There’s no VR support planned for net_demo, but it should serve as a strong foundation going forward.\nAvatars should show up again. There was some code mistake that triggered only when the default “mirror” was disabled and caused avatars not to instantiate, but I didn’t notice because I had turned it on in my checkout\nI also fixed the default sky celebration map\nAvatar bone rotations are currently broken with this setup. Seems like the head always faces a certain direction:\n\n\n\nAvatar bone rotations are broken"
