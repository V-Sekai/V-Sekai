## Context and Problem Statement

We aim to provide a compelling reason for users to stay engaged in the V-Sekai world. An idle RPG game could be the solution, offering continuous gameplay that encourages prolonged interaction.

## Proposed Solution

### Setting

Our game is set in a "Comfortable Cyberprep" realm. It merges sci-fi with ease, where tech and humans harmoniously coexist. Players explore a future city where technology is part of life. The city glows with neon lights, holographic interfaces, and advanced AI, yet retains homeliness. Buildings radiate warmth, digital trees line streets changing hues with seasons, and cafes serve VR pods with coffee. This blend of high-tech and cozy creates a unique, thrilling yet soothing ambiance, ideal for our game.

1. A well made sharp and cozy place.
2. Static couch collider: A fixed location where players can interact or rest.
3. Static bed without collider: A place for characters to rejuvenate without any physical interaction.
4. Mirror that is off: A decorative element that can be turned on for various uses.
5. Video player screen that is off: A feature that can be activated for entertainment or information.

### Story

1. Chill and hang with friends: The game will provide a relaxed environment where players can socialize.
2. Play a game: Beyond socializing, players can engage in an idle RPG game for fun and rewards.

### Systems

1. RPG idle game with fake cash chests: Players can earn fake currency through continuous play, even when they are not actively engaged.
2. Combat System: Players can choose between different types of weapons such as a sword or wand, or opt for defensive items like shields or healing items. This adds a strategic element to the game, especially in multiplayer mode.
3. Stationary Attacked Target System: A combat mechanism enabling player engagement with immobile targets.

### Development Limits

1. Settings are not persisted past server restart.
2. Limited number of weapon choices: To maintain balance in the game, the number of weapon choices can be limited.
3. Cooldown period for using healing items: To prevent spamming of healing items, a cooldown period can be implemented.
4. Limit on the number of fake cash chests that can be earned in a day: This can prevent exploitation of the system and ensure fair play.

## Implementation

The implementation details will be decided upon acceptance of this proposal.

## Positive Consequences

- Increased user engagement
- Prolonged interaction within the V-Sekai world
- Enhanced socialization among players

## Negative Consequences

- Potential increase in development time and resources
- Risk of unbalanced gameplay if the idle RPG system is not properly designed

## Option Graveyard

This section will be filled as we explore different options and discard those that are not feasible or effective.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

The frequency of use will depend on the players' engagement level. However, given the complexity of an idle RPG system, it cannot be simply worked around with a few lines of script.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Creating an idle RPG system as a feature of V-Sekai will enhance the overall user experience and engagement, which aligns with our goal of providing a compelling virtual world.
