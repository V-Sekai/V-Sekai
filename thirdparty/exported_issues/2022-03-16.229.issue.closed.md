V-Sekai,

### Context and Problem Statement

The retargeting workflows are difficult.


### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

1. work flow is live retargeting - most complicated and as is 
2. transfer animation from one character to a sharable animation
3. transfer from one character to another character 
4. bake the shared animation to gltf 
5. load a sharable animation to a charater

A) animation retargeting profile. this not modified often
B) you need a mapping of skeleton to the skeleton map profile 
C) you need mapping to play back the sharable ui 
floating panel - profile, the retarget options, source skeleton, the source map, the target skeleton and the target map 
drag and drop onto points
Select the bone to "click"
Things that don't change from one screen to another

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. StringName parent bone added to the profile
3. on the Scene advanced dialogue when clicking on the skeleton expose a boolean that show the Profile, the track target type options, the skeleton and the mapping
5. copy the skeleton retargeting settings to the animation player
7. call the extract tracks button per animation
9. validate that all the profiles map to all the tracks before retargeting on debounce cooldown.
11. probably need a profile bone config of optional for checking validation
13. use the StringName parent bone to contruct a filter on the mapping bone selection
15. a menu extract and restore animation all animations on the animation player doing nothing on ones that have been restored

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We are publishing the pr.
