### Context and Problem Statement

Load times are too long.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

This is a proposal to mask the loading time, but it doesn't solve it.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

A loading screen for when the application first starts up does make sense. However, a loading screen for switching worlds is not technically necessary.

> While this is the approach taken by the leading platform it is not the approach taken by a secondary platform. In the leading platform when you click to go to a new world, you are taken to a loading screen until your world is downloaded and you are loaded into it. In the secondary platform you are left in your original world while also loading into the second world, and once enough of the second world is loaded that you can be there, then it switches the camera and such over, and also does something interesting where it doesn't wait until it's completely loaded, but lets assets, such as models, textures, and players, load in continuously while you are there. So, by remixing here our what I think our options are.

1. Leading platform style: Loading Screen, you click go, you are put in front of a loading screen until u are loaded in completely.

2. When you click go, you are put in front of a loading screen until enough of the world you are going to is loaded in, and then you are put in that world, and experience the rest of the worlds assets and players loading in over time.

3. You click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.

4. Secondary platform loading style: You click go, and stick around in the world until enough of you is loaded in, then you are transported and get to watch as everything else loads in.

Malek like the idea of using a toaster being done noise as a signal for "you're ready to go to a new world"

### Positive Consequences

1. Able to mask loading times
2. Able to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai

For style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.

### Negative Consequences

1. coordinating cats

The drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.

It makes for a far less friction-less experience

But again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional

We could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn't happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.

### Option graveyard

- Do nothing
- Currently bad because players join and are lost.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We maintain the core.

Malek listed some options:

1. Leading peer style Loading Screen, you click go, you are put in front of a loading screen until you are loaded in completely.

2. When you click go, you are put in front of a loading screen until enough of the world you are going to is loaded in, and then you are put in that world, and experience the rest of the worlds assets and players loading in over time.

3. You click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.

4.  Secondary peer loading style, you click go, and stick around in the world until enough of you is loaded in, then you are transported and get to watch as everything else loads in.

The drawback to the multiworld load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.

While this is the approach taken by VRChat it is not the approach taken by NeosVR. In VRChat when you click to go to a new world, you are taken to a loading screen until ur world is downloaded and u are loaded into it.

VRChat Style Loading Screen, you click go, you are put in front of a loading screen until u are loaded in completely.

When you click go, you are put in front of a loading screen until enough of the world you are going to is loaded in, and then you are put in that world, and experience the rest of the worlds assets and players loading in over time.

You click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.

Neos Style loading, you click go, and stick around in the world until enough of you is loaded in, then you are transported and get to watch as everything else loads in.

The drawback to the multiworld load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.
