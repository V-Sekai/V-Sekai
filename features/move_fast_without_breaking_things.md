# Progress rapidly while avoiding damage

## Rapid Prototyping

1. Divide the project into smaller, easy-to-handle tasks.
2. Arrange tasks based on their significance and dependencies.
3. Create a minimum viable product (MVP) containing essential features.
4. Refine and enhance the MVP using user feedback and testing.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

1. Implement a version control system (For example: Git).
2. Set up a build system to automatically compile and test your code.
3. Employ a continuous integration (CI) service (e.g., Github actions, GoCD) to execute tests for every commit.
4. Utilize a continuous deployment (CD) service to keep your application current.

## Documenting Choices

1. Our project documentation is stored at [V-Sekai Manuals](https://v-sekai.github.io/manuals/).
2. Log design decisions, architectural selections, and modifications made during development.
3. Maintain updated documentation as the project progresses.
4. Motivate team members to contribute to the documentation and review each other's contributions.
