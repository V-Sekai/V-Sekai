### Context and Problem Statement

Our project involves a distributed simulation system where maintaining strong consistency and efficient workload distribution are important requirements. We are currently facing the challenge of how to handle authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers without incurring high network hop counts and latency.

Someone invited me to a popular vr platform and gave me a 20 minute tour, just enough to learn how to in desktop mode create a world, import a object and inspector-edit it. So I imported our celebration map and the map loaded in 20 seconds. I was able to change its transform. I'm still thinking about that experience.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

We propose to use a metadata system with Khepri instances and Raft consensus algorithm to manage ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes. Homeservers will manage metadata using their own Khepri instances within a Raft cluster, while simulation servers, including player simulation servers, will maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.

Authority transfer will be initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri's nested path-to-value structure will be updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates will be exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.

By monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers, we can balance the system and ensure fault tolerance using Raft's mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers will ensure efficient workload distribution and enhance the overall gaming experience.

We believe that this approach will provide strong consistency guarantees, access control, and scalability, while minimizing network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

#### Glossary of terms

1. **Homeserver**: A server responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes.
2. **Simulation server**: A server responsible for containing game entity nodes it has authority over, including player simulation servers.
3. **Khepri**: A tree-like replicated on-disk database library for Erlang and Elixir, used for maintaining a nested path-to-value store.
4. **Raft cluster**: A cluster of servers implementing the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure strong consistency and fault tolerance.
5. **Ownership**: The player who has control over a game entity and can change its state.
6. **Mastership**: The authority that can change ownership rules and default ownership settings.
7. **Ask, Deny, Allow**: Rules set by the Master for ownership transfer.

#### Protocols

- Each type of server can only be Khepri members of the same type.
- Each server can only allow be Khepri members of the same logical instance.
- Raft is only active inside of each logical instance.
- Homeserver servers are rest + json and the cheap pattern.
- Simulation servers are using the nasty state transfer pattern

#### Simulation server state transfer protocol

| Step | Action                                                                                                            |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Player A's simulation server sends a request to the home server to fetch the public key of Player B.              |
| 2    | The home server retrieves Player B's public key from its database and sends it back to Player A's simulation server. |
| 3    | Player A's simulation server uses Player B's public key to encrypt a message or binary data.                        |
| 4    | Player A's simulation server signs the encrypted message or binary data using its own private key.                 |
| 5    | Player A's simulation server sends the encrypted message or binary data along with the digital signature to Player B's simulation server using the membrane_udp_plugin. |
| 6    | Player B's simulation server receives the message and verifies the digital signature using Player A's public key, which it retrieves from the home server. |
| 7    | If the signature is valid, Player B's simulation server uses its own private key to decrypt the message and obtain the original data sent by Player A's simulation server. |
| 8    | If the message is confidential, Player B's simulation server may want to send a response back to Player A's simulation server using a similar protocol, with Player A's public key retrieved from the home server. |

This table outlines the steps of the communication protocol between Player A and Player B's simulation servers, which involves retrieving public keys from the home server's database, encrypting and signing messages, and verifying digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of the messages. This protocol ensures secure and confidential communication between the two simulation servers, allowing for safe and reliable data exchange.

# EC examples
alice_private_jwk = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file("ec-secp256r1-alice.pem")
alice_public_jwk  = JOSE.JWK.to_public(alice_private_jwk)
bob_private_jwk   = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file("ec-secp256r1-bob.pem")
bob_public_jwk    = JOSE.JWK.to_public(bob_private_jwk)

## Encrypt and Decrypt (defaults to ECDH-ES with A128GCM)
### Alice sends Bob a secret message using Bob's public key and Alice's private key
alice_to_bob = "For Bob's eyes only."
encrypted = JOSE.JWK.box_encrypt(alice_to_bob, bob_public_jwk, alice_private_jwk)
### Only Bob can decrypt the message using his private key (Alice's public key is embedded in the JWE header)
{^alice_to_bob, _} = JOSE.JWK.box_decrypt(encrypted, bob_private_jwk)
```


#### Building a Scalable Distributed Simulation System with Khepri Instances and Raft Consensus Algorithm

In a distributed simulation system, maintaining separate roles for homeservers and simulation servers and using a metadata system with strong consistency guarantees is crucial. Homeservers are responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes, using a Khepri instance within a Raft cluster. Simulation servers, including player simulation servers, maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.

Authority transfer is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri's nested path-to-value structure is updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.

Monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers allows for balancing the system and ensuring fault tolerance using Raft's mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers ensures efficient workload distribution and enhances the overall gaming experience.

## Distributed simulation architecture

Case 1: Authority transfer from Player A to Player B on a different home server

| Step | Description | Hop Count |
-- | -- | --
1 | Player A's simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop). | 1
2 | Player A's homeserver sends an acknowledgment to Player A's simulation server (1 hop). | 1
3 | Player A's homeserver sends an authority request to Player B's homeserver (H hops). | 1
4 | Player B's homeserver sends a response to Player A's homeserver (H hops). | 1
5 | Player A's homeserver sends an authority response to Player A's simulation server (1 hop). | 1
6 | Player A's simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player B's simulation server (1 hop). | 1

Total hops: 6

Case 2: Authority transfer from if Player A's and Player B's homeservers are exactly the same

| Step | Description | Hop Count |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1    | Player A's simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop). | 1 |
| 2    | Player A's homeserver sends an acknowledgment to Player A's simulation server (1 hop). | 1 |
| 3    | Player A's homeserver sends a response directly to Player B's simulation server (1 hop). | 1 |
| 4    | Player B's simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A's simulation server (1 hop). | 1 |

Total hops: 4

Case 3: Direct communication between Player A and Player B's simulation servers on the same home server.

| Step | Description | Hop Count |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- |
1 | Player A's simulation server sends an update directly to Player B's simulation server using a hand-optimized binary layout and an asynchronous communication model. | 1
2 | Player B's simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A's simulation server using credit-based flow control or another asynchronous technique. | 1

<p>In this modified version of Case 3, both the update and acknowledgment steps employ the high-performance communication system's features. This includes using hand-optimized binary layouts for data transfer and asynchronous communication techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. The total hop count remains the same at 2 hops.</p>

### Positive Consequences

- Strong consistency guarantees
- Access control over Khepri instances
- Scalability
- Minimized network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates

### Negative Consequences

- Additional complexity and infrastructure requirements

### Option graveyard

We considered using a client-server model for the distributed simulation system but found that it would not provide the strong consistency guarantees and access control we require, and it would also be more difficult to scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is not a few lines of script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I am exploring alternatives for the current implementation of the client-server model.

It sounds like a cluster of homeserver replicas would be a cluster of potential raft leaders and the simulation nodes send/receives updates to that cluster. Ball and spokes kind of model. And a simulation node would never be a raft leader, is that right?

I guess homeserver admins would be able to run a cluster or just a single instance of their homeserver. 
Does khepri still work if there's only 1 node available to be leader? 

IIRC a lot of tools that build on raft need a quorum.

Also, what kind of simulation servers would exist other than a player's?

From chatgpt4 summarization of question and answers between me and benbot.

**Is there a benefit to having non player simulation server be different than homeservers?**

The proposed architecture, which separates homeservers and simulation servers, may indeed introduce more network traffic compared to some other architectures. However, it also has some advantages that can help maintain a balance between network traffic and other aspects of the system, such as fault tolerance, scalability, and consistency.

Here are a few reasons why the network traffic overhead might be acceptable:

- Decoupling metadata management and game simulation: By separating homeservers (responsible for managing metadata) and simulation servers (responsible for managing game world elements), the system can better distribute responsibilities, allowing each type of server to focus on its specific tasks. This can result in better overall performance and scalability.
- Efficient authority transfers: In this architecture, authority transfers are handled through the homeserver Raft cluster, ensuring strong consistency guarantees for the metadata system. While this may introduce some additional network traffic for authority transfers, it also guarantees that ownership and mastership information is consistent across the system.
- Load balancing and resource management: Separating the roles of homeservers and simulation servers allows for better load balancing and resource management. This can help prevent individual servers from becoming overloaded, which can lead to reduced latency and better overall system performance.
- Fault tolerance: The use of Raft for homeserver cluster provides fault tolerance and ensures the availability of the metadata system. This helps maintain a consistent view of the game world's authority distribution, even in the presence of server failures or network issues.

While this architecture may introduce some additional network traffic, the benefits in terms of fault tolerance, scalability, and consistency can offset the trade-off. The key is to carefully manage network traffic and optimize communication between homeservers and simulation servers to minimize the impact of increased traffic on the overall system performance.

**How can the proposed architecture, which separates homeservers and simulation servers can be strongly consistent while being realtime?**

1. Homeserver-to-homeserver communication: In the proposed architecture, homeservers communicate with each other using the Raft consensus algorithm. If `N` is the number of nodes in the homeserver cluster, a strongly consistent update requires `ceil((N+1)/2)` network hops to reach a quorum.

2. Simulation server-to-simulation server communication: In a well-designed network topology and routing mechanism, the number of hops between simulation servers can be kept to a minimum. If `S` is the number of simulation servers, then the average number of hops for real-time updates can be expressed as `H(S)`, where `H` is a function of the simulation servers. A better-designed network will have a lower `H(S)` value. Optimizing this function involves minimizing the number of hops while maintaining the desired level of real-time performance.

3. Authority transfer: When players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers, the authority transfer process is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster. This process involves three steps:

    a. Sending a request from the requesting simulation server to the homeserver cluster: In the worst-case scenario, this may require `H(S)` hops.
    
    b. Processing the request within the homeserver cluster: As mentioned before, updating metadata may require `ceil((N+1)/2)` network hops, where `N` is the number of nodes in the homeserver cluster.
    
    c. Sending a response from the homeserver cluster to the new authority simulation server: In the worst-case scenario, this may require `H(S)` hops.

    d. Thus, the maximum number of network hops for the authority transfer process can be represented as `H(S) + ceil((N+1)/2) + H(S)`.

In summary, although there is no direct formula for points 1, 2, and 3, the number of network hops can be analyzed by evaluating the network topology, routing mechanisms, and the number of homeserver and simulation server nodes. By optimizing these factors, the proposed architecture can balance strong consistency and real-time performance.

Ben asks how this can be strongly consistent while being realtime?

## Distributed simulation architecture

**Initial Owner Establishment:**

| Step | Description | Hop Count |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1    | Generate public/private key pair and obtain a signed certificate from the homeserver. | N/A |
| 2    | Player A's simulation server sends an authority request to the homeserver, which includes its certificate and public key. | 1 |
| 3    | The homeserver verifies Player A's certificate and public key and sends a response to Player A's simulation server, which includes a token or key for communicating with Player B's simulation server. | 1 |

Total hop count for initial authority establishment: 2 hops.

**Switching Owners:**

| Step | Description | Hop Count |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1    | Player A's simulation server sends updates to Player B's simulation server using the token or key provided by the homeserver. | 1 |
| 2    | Player B's simulation server sends an authority request to the homeserver, which includes its certificate and public key. | 1 |
| 3    | The homeserver verifies Player B's certificate and public key and sends a response to Player A's simulation server, which includes a token or key for communicating with Player A's simulation server. | 1 |
| 4    | Player B's simulation server sends updates directly to Player A's simulation server using the token or key provided by the homeserver. | 1 |

Total hop count for switching authority: 4 hops.

The hop count for real-time updates is 1 hop.

In this architecture, homeservers handle metadata and authority management, while simulation servers are responsible for direct communication and state updates. This design maintains a balance between performance and strong consistency.

## Traditional client-server architecture

In a traditional client-server architecture, there is one central server that manages the game state and handles communication between all players. Here's a comparison of hops for the two cases mentioned earlier in a client-server model:

**Case 1: Authority transfer needed for client-server**

1. Player A's client sends a request to the central server (1 hop).
2. The central server processes the request and sends a response back to Player A's client (1 hop).
3. Player A's client sends an update to the central server (1 hop).
4. The central server sends the update to Player B's client (1 hop).

Total hops: 4

**Case 2: Authority transfer not needed for client-server**

1. Player A's client sends an update directly to the central server (1 hop).
2. The central server sends the update to Player B's client (1 hop).

Total hops: 2

## Summary

In the proposed architecture that separates homeservers and simulation servers, the load is distributed more evenly, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance. While it requires more hops compared to the traditional client-server model, it mitigates the potential bottlenecks and single points of failure that could arise in the client-server architecture.

The separation of homeservers and simulation servers also provides a clear distinction between roles, with homeservers managing metadata and authority information, and simulation servers handling game entity nodes and their interactions. This clear separation can make it easier to maintain and optimize the system.

Furthermore, the proposed architecture's use of Raft for both homeserver and simulation server clusters provides strong consistency guarantees, which is essential for maintaining a consistent game state across all players.

In conclusion, while the proposed architecture requires more hops for communication between nodes, it offers better scalability, fault tolerance, and strong consistency, making it a viable choice for distributed simulation games where the game state consistency and robustness are crucial.
