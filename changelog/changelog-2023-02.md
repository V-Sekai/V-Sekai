# Changelog 2023-02

This is the changelog for Feburary 2023.

The sdk has the entire v-sekai-game project, all the builds and git .

The game builds can be smaller but they currently have the shared_library, the executable and the gdextension interface files. It also can launch v-sekai with openxr. 

The builds are ranging to 10 minutes for a partially cached build on average. Engine builds take longer.
