The gameplay mechanics of this game are designed around a squad-based system, promoting players to form teams and develop strategies under the leadership of a commander. The role of the commander is multifaceted, involving the oversight of strategy, handling of resources, and tech upgrades. This design encourages strategic planning and effective resource management among players.

In this setup, the commander plays a pivotal role in guiding the team's actions and decisions, making the gameplay experience more dynamic and engaging. It also adds an extra layer of complexity and depth to the game, as players must not only focus on their individual roles but also consider the broader strategy and resource allocation for the team. This fosters a sense of shared responsibility and teamwork, which is central to the game's overall player experience.
