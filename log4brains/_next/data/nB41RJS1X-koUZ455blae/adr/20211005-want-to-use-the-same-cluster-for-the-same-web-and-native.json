In that case, it feels like WebRTC may jump past firewalls easier, and there's existing turn-ice stuff.\n\nMy colleague noted that you could have one Godot engine server provide a proxy to another Godot server. The design was similar to cell phone vs cell phone tower vs tower to tower distribution of messages. It wasn't clear that was possible, but he found something. Any thoughts about that?\n\n### Problems\n\nWebRTC is much more complex to set up, so I don't think it is a good alternative for ENet for indies.\n\nWebRTC needs infrastructure; ENet does not.\n\nDependency problems between ScriptInstance and PacketPeer. What do you mean?\n\nThe script_language.h includes packet_peer.h, so PacketPeer cannot use GDVIRTUAL because that needs script_language.h\n\n#### Questions\n\nHow do modern games different games have different bandwidth minimums?\n\nCents per hour to host how many players?\n\nHole-punching for pure peer-to-peer games.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nThis is compiled into the project and is work to change.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nNetworking is part of the project and can't be changed by mods.\n\n### References\n\n_No response_\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
