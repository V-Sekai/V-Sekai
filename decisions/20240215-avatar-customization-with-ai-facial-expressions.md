# Proposed: Avatar Customization with AI-Generated Facial Expressions

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: V-Sekai

## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, V-Sekai offers limited options for customizing avatars' facial expressions. This can be a hindrance for users who want to create more realistic and expressive characters. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces AI-generated facial expressions to provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.

## Proposed Solution

We propose to integrate an AI-based system that generates realistic and diverse facial expressions for avatars. This system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze and generate various emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear. The generated expressions will be seamlessly integrated into the avatar's animation system, allowing users to create more expressive characters without the need for manual editing or rigging.

### Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1.  Train an AI model using a large dataset of facial expressions: The first step is to train an AI model using a dataset containing various facial expressions. This can be done using machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or Transformers or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
2.  Generate new facial expressions based on user input: Once the AI model is trained, users will be able to generate new facial expressions by providing input parameters such as emotion type, intensity, and duration. The AI model will then generate a realistic and diverse set of expressions based on this input.
3.  Integrate the generated expressions into the avatar's animation system: The generated facial expressions will be seamlessly integrated into the avatar's animation system, allowing users to create more expressive characters without the need for manual editing or rigging.

### Benefits

- More realistic and diverse facial expressions
- Enhanced avatar customization options
- Improved user experience
