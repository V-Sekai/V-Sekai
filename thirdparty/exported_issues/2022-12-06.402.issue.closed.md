### Context and Problem Statement

Have a checklist of tasks needed for recording demos.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

I want to have consistency for the videos I record.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

- [ ] Do I have a keyboard to screen displayer?
- [ ] Does the video have a V-Sekai logo?
- [ ] Does the video have a work in progress disclaimer?
- [ ] Do I have a time code bar with V-Sekai Game prefix and a timezone suffix?
- [ ] Is it under 4 megabytes?

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a script for filming.
