<li>Living Design Standards</li>
</ol>
<p>The six mechanisms that make up the quality control system are mentoring supervision, chief engineers, cross-functional communication, working instructions and standards.</p>
<p>Mentoring supervision serves mainly to build functional expertise, but it also teaches young engineers how to write and interpret reports, work with chief engineers, and understand and use standards. The chief engineer’s prestige reinforces the importance of expertise while it also balances out the functional bent of the other engineers. The chief engineer also promotes mutual adjustment by providing the working instructions for each vehicle program and by resolving cross-functional disagreements.</p>
<p>The second mechanism is cross-functional communication. Every major feature requires at least an introduction so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.</p>

<p>To optimize end to end interpolation, you can use line graphs and scatter plots. A line graph shows the progress of an animation over time, while a scatter plot shows the data points that were used to create an animation.</p>
<p>A line graph can help you debug physics interpolation issues. If your object’s position is not moving smoothly, you can look at how it moved over time and see if there are any sudden changes or jumps in its motion that might be causing problems. This will help you determine whether you need to adjust your physics simulation or tweak some other aspect of your game design.</p>
<p>Second, you can use scatter plots to visualize how different variables interact with each other. For example, if you have an object that’s supposed to move along a straight line but instead moves in a curved path, then it might be helpful for you to see whether there are any correlations between its position and its velocity. This will help you isolate which variables are causing this behavior so that you can optimize them individually or together.</p>

<p>We implement the wasm scripts using libsql and a wasm runtime to be determined.</p>
<p>We had a previous implementation called WASGO. Possible names for the new one is WASGOQuery and WASGO.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>WAMR wasn’t well liked because it’s written in c/c++ and because it’s not widely used.</li>
<li>WASMTIME is widely used and used for commercial / financial applications</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>WASMTIME rust is hard to deploy</li>
<li>WAMR is hard to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Open Questions:</p>
<p>Does it require determinism for clustering?</p>

<p>When you first start up the application, you will see a loading screen. This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.</p>
<p>When switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one–you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.</p>
<p>You click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.</p>

<p>The drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.</p>
<p>It makes for a far less friction-less experience</p>
<p>But again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional</p>
<p>We could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn’t happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.</p>
