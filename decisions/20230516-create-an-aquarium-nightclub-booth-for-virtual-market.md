## Context and Problem Statement

Fill a 4m wide x 4m deep x 5m tall space with an Aquarium Nightclub theme.

## Proposed Solution

Design an immersive environment that combines elements of an aquarium and a nightclub. The booth should include aquatic-themed decorations, lighting, interactive elements, and a hostess to engage visitors.

### Key Features

1. **Aquatic-themed decorations**: Use 3D models of marine life, such as fish, corals, and seaweed, to create a realistic underwater environment.
2. **Dynamic lighting**: Implement the ambiance of a nightclub.
3. **Interactive elements**: Add interactive components, such as touch-sensitive screens or motion sensors, to allow visitors to interact with the marine life and control the lighting effects.
4. **Jellyfish Hostess**:

**JellyBell**, our enchanting hostess, welcomes visitors and showcases the booth's offerings with her ethereal presence.

Wearing an **Iridescent Gown** with sheer fabric and ribbons, her aquatic charm is amplified. As a knowledgeable guide, JellyBell provides guests with an engaging booth experience.

5. **Ambient music**: Include background music that complements the aquarium and nightclub themes.

## Implementation

1. Design and model the 3D assets for the marine life, corals, seaweed, and hostess.
2. Implement the interactive elements using appropriate input devices and programming.
3. Add a hostess character into the booth.
4. Integrate the ambient music into the environment.

## Positive Consequences

- Attracts visitors with its unique and engaging theme.
- Provides an immersive experience that combines education and entertainment.
- Encourages interaction and exploration within the virtual environment.
- The hostess adds a personal touch and enhances visitor engagement.

## Negative Consequences

- May require significant development time and resources to create high-quality 3D assets, implement interactive features, and develop the hostess AI.
- Could be challenging to balance the two themes (aquarium and nightclub) without one overpowering the other.
- Integrating dynamic lighting and shaders with an existing environment may require additional effort and customization.

## Option Graveyard

- Creating a simple static environment without interactive elements.
- Focusing solely on either the aquarium or nightclub theme.

## If this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

No, this enhancement requires significant design and development work to create an immersive and interactive environment.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Yes, creating a unique and engaging booth for the virtual market exhibition is essential for attracting visitors and showcasing our capabilities in virtual reality development.
