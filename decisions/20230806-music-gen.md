## Context

In the 21st century, technology has become an integral part of our lives. It has also made significant strides in the field of music. One such advancement is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate music. This document proposes a solution for generating music with computer assistance.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to generate music with the help of computer programs.

## Proposed Solution

One potential solution is to use .ABC files. These files have been successful in generating outputs with AI models like GPT-3. The .ABC files contain data in the header section like the key signature, tempo, and time signature, which can be added to the prompt.

Alternatively, we could use AI models to write a script for us. For instance, we could request a Python script that writes the chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes. The output format could be something convenient like Lilypond or MusicXML.

Here's a sample Python script:

```python
def generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals():
    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']
    intervals = []

    for i in range(len(notes)):
        seventh_interval = (i + 10) % len(notes)
        intervals.append((notes[i], notes[seventh_interval]))

    return intervals

print(generate_chromatic_seventh_intervals())
```

Another viable solution might be to use AI models to generate Lilypond syntax. Lilypond is a powerful and flexible tool for engraving tasks of all kinds, for example sheet music, complex notation, vocal music, etc. Here is an example of a simple Lilypond syntax:

```lilypond
\relative c' {
  c4 d e f |
  g a b c |
}
```

This code will generate a sequence of eighth notes from C to C.

## Discarded Options

During the process of finding a solution, several options were considered and discarded for various reasons:

1. **Using MIDI files:** While MIDI files are commonly used for music generation, they were discarded due to their complexity and the difficulty in generating them programmatically.

2. **Using MusicXML:** Although MusicXML is a comprehensive and widely supported format, it was discarded due to its verbose and complex structure, which makes it difficult to generate programmatically.

3. **Using other music notation software:** Other music notation software like Finale and Sibelius were considered, but discarded due to their proprietary nature and lack of support for programmatic generation of music.

## Positive Consequences

- This approach will allow for easier generation of music.
- It will bypass the limitations posed by the complex structure of MusicXML.

## Negative Consequences

- There may be some challenges when using AI models to generate Lilypond syntax.
- Training small transformers to output syntactically correct .ABC files might pose a challenge.
