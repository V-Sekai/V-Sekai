# V-Sekai Changelog - December 2023

## [Released]

- **2023-12-11 20:10**: Unidot Importer | Unidot Importer. Unidot is a .unitypackage asset interoperability tool to bring assets designed for other engines into Godot Engine. Check it out [here](https://unidotengine.org/).
- **2023-12-12 04:19**: Unidot was submitted to the asset library! We have a separate discord server for Unidot Importer: [Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/JzXkxMRd9x). It's kind of a companion for V-Sekai, but I expect a lot of general game developers joining who have little interest in VR or social virtual worlds, so I think it's good to have a separate community.
