You may want to articulate the problem in the form of a question.]\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse kaolin for some of the tools.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin.git`\n1. Install https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge\n1. `conda create --name kaolin python=3.9`\n1. `conda activate kaolin`\n1. `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch`\n1. Test the install. `python -c \"import kaolin; print(kaolin.__version__)\"`\n\n### Questions\n\nHi fire , thanks for your interest in Kaolin. Currently probably the best way to learn Kaolin is to take a look through the documentation and look for relevant functions. We hope to make more demos which will make learning Kaolin smoother in the future.\n\nThe functions which will be useful to you would be:\n\n`kaolin.io.obj.import_mesh` to import a mesh.\n\n`torch.meshgrid` to generate a bunch of 3D coordinates of a voxel grid.\n\n`kaolin.metrics.trianglemesh.point_to_mesh_distance` to get the distance function for those points.\n\n`kaolin.ops.mesh.check_sign` to get the sign of the points to multiply with the distance.\n\n`kaolin.ops.conversions.voxelgrids_to_trianglemeshes` to convert the SDF grid to a mesh.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Might require the GPU.\n- Inferencing may be difficult at interactive rates.\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->\n- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nCUDA, PyTorch and c++ are significant works.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI have an approach!\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
