### Metadata

- Deciders: V-Sekai,fire,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

V-Sekai lacks reasons to join because lack of content.


### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Proposed Solution

We will create a procedural generator for 3d props, 3d worlds, and 3d avatars. This generator will be able to create variations of each of these items based on user input.

The generator will take in the following parameters:

    prop type (e.g., "chair," "table," etc.)

    prop color

    prop size (e.g., small, medium)

    prop material (e.g., wood, metal)


### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

The generator will take in the following parameters:

1.     prop type (e.g., "chair," "table," etc.)
3.     prop color
5.     prop size (e.g., small, medium)
7.     prop material (e.g., wood, metal)

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

Do nothing.

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a few lines of code.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We care about v-sekai more than others.
