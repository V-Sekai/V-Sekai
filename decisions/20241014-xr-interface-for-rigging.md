# Proposed: Editing Character Body Bone Constraints in Immersive Mode

## The Context

V-Sekai is a social VR community.

## The Problem Statement

We aim to develop a prototype interface for editing bone constraints such as position, rotation, twist rotation, and swing rotation on character body bones within an immersive environment.

## Proposal Description

### Interactive Design Concept

The proposed system will allow users to interact directly with avatar bone structures in a 3D space, manipulating constraints through intuitive gestures and tools. This approach aims to enhance user engagement and precision in modifying avatars.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Visual Representation of Bones**:
   - Each bone will be represented by a dot that becomes visible and enlarges when the user's hand or controller approaches it, facilitating easy selection.

2. **Selection Mechanism**:
   - Users can select a bone by pointing at it and using a trigger action on their controller. Upon selection, related constraints (e.g., twist, swing) will be displayed around the bone.

3. **Constraint Manipulation Tools**:
   - A virtual tool palette will be available to the user, containing different constraint modifiers.
   - Users can grab these tools and attach them to selected bones to adjust constraints like angles and rotations.

4. **Tool Switcher Interface**:
   - In addition to the tool palette, a tool switcher mechanism will be implemented allowing users to quickly switch between tools without returning to the palette. This could be activated via a gesture or a button press, bringing up a radial or linear menu to select the desired tool.

5. **Intuitive Constraint Adjustment**:
   - For rotational constraints, a 3D gizmo will appear, allowing users to manipulate the angle directly within the VR space.
   - Swing constraints will be adjusted using a spherical interface where permissible rotation areas are defined by the user.

6. **Feedback and Precision**:
   - Visual and haptic feedback will be provided to ensure users are aware of the changes they are making.
   - Precision tools and snapping features will help in making exact adjustments.

7. **Deselection and Context Switching**:
   - Moving the controller away from the bones or performing a specific gesture will deselect the current selection, allowing for a smooth workflow without accidental adjustments.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Direct manipulation of bones and constraints in VR enhances the intuitiveness and enjoyment of avatar customization.
- **Increased Precision**: Fine control over adjustments leads to more accurate and satisfying results.
- **Seamless Workflow**: Integration of tools and selections within the VR environment reduces the cognitive load and context switching, fostering a more creative and productive user experience.

## Downsides

- **Complexity in Implementation**: Developing a fully interactive 3D UI with precise control mechanisms can be challenging and time-consuming.
- **Performance Concerns**: High fidelity models and real-time updates in VR may lead to performance issues on lower-end systems.

## The Road Not Taken

- **2D GUI for Constraint Management**: Using a traditional 2D interface for constraint management was considered but rejected due to the lack of immersion and intuitiveness in a VR context.

## In Core and Done by Us

This feature is core to the V-Sekai project's mission of enhancing VR interaction and will be developed internally to maintain control over quality and integration.
