Use for verifying binaries\n2. Use for verifying game modifications\n3. Used for lobby servers to prove to the player that they are official.\n4. Double sided friending\n\n### 02 List of uses for ssh signatures\n\n```bash\n# Extract the private key from the P12:\nopenssl pkcs12 -in my_cert.p12 -out my_cert.pem -nodes\nopenssl pkcs12 -in my_cert.p12 -out my_sshkeys.pem -nodes -nocerts\n# Finally extract the public key from the certificate PEM file and append it to the private key:\nopenssl x509 -in my_cert.pem -pubkey -noout >> my_sshkeys.pem\n# my_cert.pem can now be removed. It is not required anymore.\n# You can use ssh-keygen to create the line to put into your remote `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:\nssh-keygen -i -m PKCS8 -f my_sshkeys.pem\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add my_sshkeys.pem\n# https://trueg.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/use-an-x-509-certificate-for-ssh-login/\n# TODO: fire 2021-11-13 use mbedtls only\n```\n\n### 03 Encrypt files\n\nOpen problems:\n\n1. Separating authentication from encryption\n2. Ensuring smime doesn't lose any file data\n\n### 04 Distributing keys\n\n```bash\n# Resulting file is namespace.allowed_signers but uri_encoded.\ncurl https://github.com/fire.keys > avatars%40V-Sekai.com.allowed_signers # Needs a id in email syntax in front of a key \ncurl files://uro > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format\ncurl http://matrix-homeserver.example.com/fire > avatars%40V-sekai.com.allowed_signers # Assumed in correct format\n```\n\n### 05 Envelope\n\n```bash\n# Email multipart\n\n1. Use email multipart\n\n# Uncompressed zip\n\nAvoid compression explosions.\n\n1. zip AvatarSample_A.vrm.sig\n2. zip AvatarSample_A.vrm \n```\n\n### 06 Principal in `allowed_signers`\n\nThe allowed_signers file associates a string that represents a person (Principle) to a Public Key.\n\n```\n# https://blog.sigstore.dev/ssh-is-the-new-gpg-74b3c6cc51c0\nUSERNAME=\"fire\"\ncurl https://github.com/${USERNAME}.keys | while read key; do\n  echo \"$USERNAME $key\" >> allowed_signers\ndone\n```\n\nHow to check the principal?\n\n```\n# https://blog.sigstore.dev/ssh-is-the-new-gpg-74b3c6cc51c0\ncat FILE | ssh-keygen -Y verify -n file -f allowed_signers.github -I USER -s FILE.sig\n```\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Able to distribute a game launcher.\n- Able to add a makers mark to items.\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, â€¦]\n\n[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Matrix \n- Rejection Reason: Technically complicated to devops start and multiple layers compared to an offline approach.\n\n- Option: Ipfs and Etherium \n- Rejection Reason: Requires a globally distributed database.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot able to use a few lines of code.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe have to define the trust.\n\n## References <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://github.com/V-Sekai/\n- https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/tree/main/pkg/pki/ssh\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4629537/how-to-encrypt-data-in-php-using-public-private-keys\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
