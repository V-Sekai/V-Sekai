<h1>Biomimicry Design Process</h1>
<section id="step-1-define" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-define">Step 1: Define</h2>
<p>The first step in the biomimicry design process is to define the problem or opportunity that you want your design to address.</p>
<section id="a.-frame-your-challenge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-frame-your-challenge">a. Frame Your Challenge</h3>
<p>Give a simple explanation of the impact you want to have. This is not what you want to make, but what you want your design to achieve or do.</p>
</section>
<section id="b.-consider-context" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-consider-context">b. Consider Context</h3>
<p>Describe some of the contextual factors that are important to the challenge. This could include stakeholders, location conditions, resource availability, etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="c.-take-a-systems-view-and-look-for-potential-leverage-points" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-take-a-systems-view-and-look-for-potential-leverage-points">c.&nbsp;Take a Systems View and Look for Potential Leverage Points</h3>
<p>Think about the system surrounding the problem (or opportunity) you are designing for. What interactions and relationships are part of its context? What are the system boundaries and connections to other systems?</p>
</section>
<section id="d.-phrase-your-challenge-as-a-question" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d.-phrase-your-challenge-as-a-question">d.&nbsp;Phrase Your Challenge as a Question</h3>
<p>Using the information above, phrase your challenge as a question: How might we __? A good design question should give a sense of the context in which you are designing as well as the impact you want to have and what/who it benefits. Your question should be somewhat open-ended to ensure you haven’t jumped to conclusions about what you are designing.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="step-2-biologize" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-biologize">Step 2: Biologize</h2>
<p>Analyze the essential functions and context your design challenge must address. Reframe them in biological terms, so that you can “ask nature” for advice. The goal of this step is to arrive at one or more “How does nature…?” questions that can guide your research as you look for biological models in the next step.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3-discover" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-discover">Step 3: Discover</h2>
<p>Look for natural models (organisms and ecosystems) that need to address the same functions and context as your design solution. Identify the strategies used that support their survival and success. This step focuses on research and information gathering.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-4-abstract" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4-abstract">Step 4: Abstract</h2>
<p>Carefully study the essential features or mechanisms that make the biological strategy successful. Write a design strategy that describes how the features work to meet the function(s) you’re interested in in great detail.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-5-emulate-natures-lessons" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-5-emulate-natures-lessons">Step 5: Emulate Nature’s Lessons</h2>
<p>Once you have found a number of biological strategies and analyzed them for the design strategies you can extract, you are ready to begin the creative part—dreaming up nature-inspired solutions. Here we’ll guide you through the key activities of the Emulate step.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="note" class="level1">

<section id="v-sekai-game" class="level1">
<h1>1. V-Sekai Game</h1>
<p>We want to have is to create an immersive gaming experience that blends elements of science fiction and horror, offers a variety of gameplay options, and emphasizes strategic decision-making with significant consequences.</p>
<p>The contextual factors important to this challenge include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has colonized the solar system.</li>
<li>Gameplay involves both player versus player and player versus environment scenarios.</li>
<li>Players form alliances and strategize to protect humanity from existential threats.</li>
<li>Decisions made in the game can shape the future of the virtual universe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system surrounding this problem includes the game mechanics, player interactions, AI integration, and the narrative context (post-apocalyptic future, colonization of the solar system). Interactions and relationships within this system could involve player-to-player cooperation or competition, player interaction with the environment, and player engagement with the game’s narrative and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Considering the above, we might phrase your challenge as follows: “How might we create an immersive, strategic gaming experience that effectively blends elements of science fiction and horror, offers varied gameplay options, and allows players’ decisions to significantly impact the game’s universe?”</p>
<p>The gameplay mechanics of this game are designed around a team-based system, promoting players to form teams and develop strategies under the leadership of a lead. The role of the lead is multifaceted, involving the oversight of strategy, handling of resources, and tech upgrades. This design encourages strategic planning and effective resource management among players.</p>
<section id="integration-of-gadget-mechanics-in-gameplay-mechanics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integration-of-gadget-mechanics-in-gameplay-mechanics">Integration of Gadget Mechanics in Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
<p>The <code>Gadget Mechanics</code> play a crucial role in enhancing the <code>Gameplay Mechanics</code>. Each gadget provides unique abilities that can be utilized strategically within the team-based system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Object Manipulation</strong>: This gadget can be used to create barriers or clear paths, aiding in strategic planning and resource management. It can also be used to solve puzzles that could lead to resource acquisition or unlocking new areas on the map.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Range Targeting</strong>: This gadget can be used by players assigned as snipers or scouts in the team, allowing them to take down targets from a distance or relay information about enemy positions to their team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spell Casting</strong>: This gadget adds a layer of complexity to combat situations. Players can use this gadget to cast spells that can heal teammates, enhance their abilities, or damage enemies. The lead can guide the usage of these spells based on the team’s strategy.</p></li>

<section id="player-experience" class="level1">
<h1>3. Player Experience</h1>
<p>The essence of this game lies in its cooperative environment that not only encourages but also rewards teamwork. The game presents challenges and obstacles that are not just hurdles to be overcome by a single player’s skill, but rather puzzles that demand a collective effort and strategy.</p>
<p>In the context of this game, victory over obstacles is a shared experience, creating a sense of camaraderie among players. The game emphasizes on how well you can work with others, strategize as a team, and utilize each other’s strengths to achieve common objectives.</p>
<p>This focus on teamwork isn’t limited to just the gameplay mechanics. It seeps into the entire player experience, influencing how players interact with the game world and each other. The game isn’t about individual superiority, but about effective teamwork and contributing towards the group’s success.</p>
<section id="skill-gates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="skill-gates">Skill Gates</h2>
<p>“Skill gates” are a unique feature in the game that serve as checkpoints. These gates are strategically placed throughout the game’s levels and require players to demonstrate a specific skill they’ve learned in order to progress.</p>
<p>For instance, if a player has learned a new combat move or magic spell, they might encounter a skill gate where they must use this new ability effectively to overcome an obstacle or defeat an enemy. This not only tests the player’s understanding and mastery of the new skill, but also provides a satisfying challenge and sense of progression.</p>
</section>
<section id="level-design" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="level-design">Level Design</h2>
<p>The level design in the game plays a crucial role in ensuring that players acquire necessary skills and abilities before they encounter major challenges. This is achieved through various means:</p>
<p>The game’s levels are designed with a <strong>Progressive Difficulty</strong> curve. This means that early levels are relatively easy, allowing players to learn the basic mechanics and controls of the game. As players progress, the levels become more challenging, requiring them to apply and refine the skills they’ve learned.</p>
<p>Each level often includes specific <strong>Skill-Based Challenges</strong> or obstacles that require certain skills to overcome. By strategically placing these challenges, the game ensures that players have had the opportunity to learn and practice these skills before they’re needed for major challenges.</p>
<p>The level design also encourages <strong>Rewarding Exploration</strong>. Hidden areas or secret paths might contain power-ups or abilities that can help players in future challenges. This not only rewards curiosity but also ensures players are well-equipped for upcoming challenges.</p>
<p>Major challenges, such as <strong>Boss Battles</strong>, are typically placed at the end of levels or sections. These act as tests of the skills and abilities players have gained throughout the level. They provide a clear goal for players to strive towards and offer a satisfying conclusion to each level.</p>
</section>
<section id="teamwork-over-solo-play" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teamwork-over-solo-play">6. Teamwork Over Solo Play</h2>
<p>In this game, teamwork is given more importance than solo play. This design choice reflects the cooperative nature of the game, where players are encouraged to form parties or teams and face challenges together.</p>
<p>The game’s <strong>Cooperative Gameplay</strong> design ensures that many of its missions and challenges are best tackled as a team. This could involve strategizing together, combining different character abilities, or simply working together to overcome powerful enemies or complex puzzles. This approach encourages social interaction and cooperation among players, making the game a truly collaborative experience.</p>
<p>To support this cooperative gameplay, the game provides an option for players to form <strong>Parties or Teams</strong>. These groups can work together, plan strategies, and combine their strengths to conquer the game’s challenges. This not only enhances the social aspect of the game but also adds an extra layer of strategic depth, making the gameplay more engaging and rewarding.</p>
<p>The game’s emphasis on <strong>Overcoming Challenges Together</strong> fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared achievement among players. When players overcome a difficult challenge together, it creates a rewarding experience that can be more satisfying than solo victories. This shared success promotes a sense of unity and accomplishment, enhancing the overall gaming experience.</p>

<section id="emulate-natures-lessons" class="level1">
<h1>Emulate Nature’s Lessons</h1>
<p>Emulating nature’s lessons involves taking the abstracted design strategy and applying it to our specific problem. In this case, we’re designing a VR interface that allows users to interact with virtual objects in a natural and intuitive way.</p>
<p>Here’s how we can emulate nature’s lessons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Direct Manipulation</strong>: We’ll allow users to interact directly with virtual objects using their hands or controllers. This will involve tracking the user’s hand movements and translating them into actions within the VR environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Sensory Feedback</strong>: We’ll provide feedback through multiple senses to help users understand the results of their actions. This could involve visual changes in the VR environment, sounds, and haptic feedback through the controllers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Information</strong>: We’ll use visual and auditory cues to provide contextual information. For example, objects might get larger as they get closer, or make different sounds depending on their material.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By emulating these features of human interaction with physical objects, we can create a VR interface that feels natural and intuitive to use.</p>
