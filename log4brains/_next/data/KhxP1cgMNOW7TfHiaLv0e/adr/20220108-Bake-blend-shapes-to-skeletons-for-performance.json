I want to bake the entire 52 face blendshape movements and the rest of the vrm blend shapes to a single animation track.\n2. I can send it to dem bones and bake the blend shapes.\n\n### Dem Bones baking procedure\n\n1. Merge all meshes into one mesh (current limitation)\n2. Export one animation as an alembic sequence\n3. Export fbx with a meter to centimeter conversion\n4. Run dem bones (parameters to be determined)\n5. Use the resulting fbx\n\n### Open questions:\n\nI align each track to a second? one after the others? \n\nHow do I find the tracks again?\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Better performance\n- Able to compose animations\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- More bones\n\n## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->\n\n- Option: Status quo\n- Rejection Reason: Blend shapes are slow and uncomposable.\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot a few lines of code to do error bound matching and geometry processing.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nI know how to do this! \n\n## References <!-- optional and numbers of links can vary -->\n\n- https://github.com/electronicarts/dem-bones\n\n## Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
