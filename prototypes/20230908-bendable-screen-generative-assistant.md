# Sell a Generative Assistant Screen

## Metadata  

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai  
- **Tags**: `V-Sekai`, `Generative AI`, `Godot Engine`, `GGML`, `Digital Assistant`, `VRM1 Avatars` 

## Context  

The proposal is to create a generative AI using the Godot engine. This AI will be displayed on a device with an OLED display. The system will also incorporate various sensors and a posing compute module. Additionally, there is direct support for importing VRM1 avatars.

## Problem  

The main challenge is to use GGML for both conversation interactions (openllama) and voice commands (whisper). The end goal is to create a digital assistant similar to Siri. However, surviving in game development can be challenging.

## Proposal  

The strategy is to exclude Python and focus on using GGML. This approach will require a deep understanding of GGML and its applications in creating interactive and responsive AI.

## Pros  

The upside is the creation of a unique digital assistant that leverages the power of generative AI. This could potentially revolutionize the way we interact with technology and open up new possibilities in the field of AI.

## Cons  

The downside is the complexity and difficulty of the project. It requires a high level of expertise and knowledge in several areas including GGML, Godot engine, and AI development.

## Road not taken   

One possible path that was considered but not pursued was the integration of Python alongside GGML. While Python is a powerful and versatile language that could have added more flexibility to the project, it was ultimately decided that focusing solely on GGML would allow for a more specialized and optimized system. Another road not taken was to use a pre-existing AI framework instead of building one from scratch. This could have saved time and resources, but it would have limited the customization and unique features of our digital assistant.

## Limitations  

This project may not be suitable for those who are not familiar with GGML or do not have a background in AI development.

## Ownership  

Yes, this project will be developed by us, leveraging our expertise in AI and game development.
