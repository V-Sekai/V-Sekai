# Accepted: AI-Assisted Style Guide

## The Context

Maintaining a consistent and professional style is crucial in proposal writing. However, the output often needs more stylistic quality when AI assists in this process.

## The Problem Statement

We often need better style and consistent formatting when we instruct AI to help complete our proposals.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. **Avoid Purple Speech**: Use clear and concise language, avoiding overly elaborate or flowery expressions.
2. **Be Snappy**: Keep sentences short and concise to maintain reader engagement.
3. **Avoid Coded Phrases**: Refrain from using coded phrases like "effective altruism" since altruism inherently implies effectiveness and not the opposite.
4. **Keep Consistent Headers**: Please be sure to adhere to the header structure provided in the template to ensure consistency across documents.

## The Benefits

- **Improved Readability**: Clear and concise language enhances the readability of proposals.
- **Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent style ensures that all documents appear professionally.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined guidelines make it easier for AI to generate high-quality content quickly.

## The Downsides

- **Limited Creativity**: Strict adherence to style guidelines may limit creative expression.
- **Initial Setup Time**: Establishing and fine-tuning the style guide may require an initial investment of time and resources.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative approaches, such as manual editing or using different AI models, were considered but ultimately deemed less efficient or effective.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In scenarios where highly specialized or technical language is required, additional human oversight may be necessary to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.
