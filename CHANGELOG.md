## 2022-06-05

1. Fire collaborated on godot-snappy for object snapping https://github.com/jgillich/godot-snappy
2. Try to integrate manifold again.

## 2022-06-03

https://gitlab.com/bramw/baserow/-/issues/998 Spent some documenting the baserow io system on Digital Ocean used to store in-progress art assets, data from research and 3d galleries.

Donated research on avatar generation to the MIT-licensed project at https://github.com/AtlasFoundation/OpenCharacterCreator As part of: [lightweight-quality-avatars](decisions/2022/20220601-lightweight-quality-avatars.md)

## 2022-06-01

* Lyuma uncommented some code in vsk_avatar/ik_space.gd to create IK tracking points on the server, to enable IK sync via server. TL;DR (Other peers can see other peers while connected to a server.)

![Movement Debugged Lyuma](decisions/2022/attachments/movement_debugged_lyuma.png)

* Server sync issue removed from todo list.

## 2022-05-29

https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-seurat is dependent on being able to fetch 16 bit float buffers https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/54122#issuecomment-1140414946.

## 2022-05-29

1. Investigated technical art via breaking apart the cafe
2. Investigated [DagAmendment](https://github.com/eliemichel/DagAmendment) for brush based refinement of csg shapes.

## 2022-05-26

1. Characters now load but the pose is incorrect. 
2. Maps load from a new sdk uploader.
3. The content picker is bad and ugly but usable to pick maps to host and choose avatars.
4. The server sees all clients but the clients only see the server and not each other.
5. The vr pose is incorrect but you can see the error so it hasn't catastrophically exploded.

Lyuma

Made a lot of progress towards animation import in Unidot. Godot's node system means that some paths become different: for example, meshes have to be reparented to skeletons; or extra levels in the hierarchy to keep track of physics bodies.

To this end, it is now keeping a lookup dictionary from path and component to fileID (which can be mapped to Godot node) which means animation support should be close.

(Also, they made a major change to the import system in 2019 which affects id numbering. Still working on it)

Pushed a major update to Unidot, mostly in the post_import script. It should now generate paths much more accurately to the original file, and implemented the hashing algorithm used by Unity 2019 for file ID generation, for example generating ids like 919132149155446097 for the root object.

This has fixed some assets exported from Unity 2019 like below, which used to fail to resolve the fileIDs for meshes! @iFire 

Made some progress with terrain import in Unidot. It will import textures, normalmaps and splatmaps (creating an appropriate ShaderMaterial). My plan is to implement trees and grass using MultimeshInstance objects. With this I also now support texture assets. Texture Arrays seem to fail internally. Hard to tell if I did something wrong or something isn't implemented on Godot's end, but we'll get there...

performance-wise, I think it's now acceptable to just pipe all 2+ million polygons (for 1025x1025 terrain) to the GPU. I'm using tristrips so it's mostly just 1 index per triangle. It might be better to use a more dedicated terrain system for this, so this is just a stopgap while Godot 4 is in development since the terrain systems in the asset library are not keeping up with the rapid pace of development.
(if you're interested in this subject, feel free to start a thread or reply on godot-general) 

Terrain trees, splatmaps and materials are implemented in Unidot, converting to a single conventional terrain mesh + multimesh. I have not implemented holes yet, but if someone has an example and there is demand, I could work on it.

I also chose not to implement detail (grasses), because I don't understand how detail patches are implemented, and they tend to not look that great in VR, so I'd rather work on something else.

## 2022-04-14

* Restore fix-save-as-binary so we can export projects
* Restore elixir shared branch so we can run godot in elixir
* Poked ludwig about diffusion net for machine learning training.

### Added

iFire: Added https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-proposals/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

iFire: Update FBX2glTF to create packaged release tags.

iFire: Wild goose chased godot 3.4 webxr. the goose flew away this time.

iFire: Evaluating Godot 4 for the web. 2D only. Builds in a bit from itch and cicd

iFire: I'll be arranging the OMI gltf2 group meeting tomorrow. It's currently wednesday. Need figure out what people are doing and reflect that.

iFire: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/54886 Lyuma pr for blend i/o. Pending pr proposal. Discussed with the Godot Discord community and with Reduz.

Lyuma: the above is in reference to the .blend, .bvh (via bleneer) and .usdz (via blender) importers for Godor 4 and 3.3+

iFire: Ported and split the blender assisted addons into 6 branches and 3 repos

theoway: Visual script updates. https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/3548

iFire: Ventured into MaterialX slack channel and asked for answers. Answers were found.

Lyuma: Wrote a simple .bvh importer for Godot using @iFire [He/Him]'s blender importer as a base (importing using blender).

iFire: Onboarded a few people onto Godot 4 Groups from older versions

iFire: Finishing touches on blend import for Godot Engine

Lyuma: reworked scene export

### Changes

iFire: Builds of fbx2gltf from github cicd are now at https://github.com/V-Sekai/FBX2glTF/releases

iFire: Updated the godot branch. There was some some difficult with the blend-io branch so I merged it with other branch import something

MMMaellon: Didn't we use to have an IK channel? Anyway here's some of my ideas on how I plan to revamp RenIK. I'm still hoping that EWBIK takes over RENIK's IK solving one day, so I'm focusing on improving the walk cycle and leaving IK solving alone https://mmmaellon.notion.site/Semi-Deterministic-Walk-Cycles-dbe1dcaa307e4fb9b85dd6ee920de20c

iFire — 07/11/2021: Groups update to the latest Godot. 1. intersect rays api changed. 2. misc crash if precondition fails return
Oops forgot to upload a few branches.

iFire — 08/11/2021: https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-blender Now works on my Linux. Need some testing for Windows and Mac. Save a blend file into the godot project and it'll be openable as scene through tricks.

iFire — 08/11/2021: Will be around in voice call for an 30m to 1 hour.

iFire — 09/11/2021: Cleared some godot engine github backlog. Wheeee

We got quite a lot of demand to make the GLTF importer part of core, given it is needed for VR and other stuff, so I have the feeling we should optimize it for performance (which we should do anyway) and have an option to load actual meshes instead of EditorImporterMesh.. so that means we would need to provide a function to parse the mesh node into a scene node and the editor supplies, otherwise it uses Mesh as a default

- 2021-09-04 01:30:12Z lyuma: We found an infinite recursion bug in the godot gltf exporter caused by the construction of gltf node objects from skeletons and skins. I believe the issue is treating skeletons as special objects, and if we expand skeleton bones to nodes initially that should simplify things greatly and prevent this type of bug.

- 2021-09-02 03:56:26Z lyuma: "Progress on Unidot Importer: I made some major fixes on binary asset deserialization: I finally figured out how padding works (short answer: flag 0x4000 adds padding after a byte or short), and fixed a crash by implementing support for Unity 4.x and earlier assets, since you never know where they will show up.

Next up is parsing the texture filename mapping from FBX files to assist in material discovery, since Unity legacy materials default to lookup by texture _filename_ rather than material name or texture name. Since Godot has no means for preserving the original filename on import when the files are not present, doing a fix to the FBX2glTF tool won't quite cover my necessary usecase, so I think extracting the map in the tooling is easiest. Will probably revisit this decision later." 👍 (4)

- 2021-06-19 19:22:18Z Saracen: Further fixes, there's workarounds now for the tool I wrote to extract root motion. Two of the notable bugs I've discovered are ConfigFile.load returning random values and the fact that there doesn't seem to be implicit casting between String and StringName. Want to create some example projects for this. It's also worth noting that while Amethyst is close to being functional now, it's running OBSCENELY slow at the moment. 🦥 (1)

It of course needs proper robust testing (we'll organize something to try and break the security), but I consider it mostly done. Some remaining issues: ensuring mesh and colliders are not on reserved layers, exposing more things as value tracks, exposing more canvas UI elements, better error reporting, checking for cyclic node dependencies, checking entity 'model' scenes, properly embedding 3D canvas data on exporter, properly embedding model resources, enabling checks only for web scenes. 👍 (1)

- 2021-05-21 22:51:16Z lyuma: "I worked with fire on debugging glTF. I think we're going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.

  1. Radical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.
  2. Add BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.
  3. While in `_determine_skeletons`, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the `_determine_skeletons` code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.

  Bugs:

  1. Animations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects
  2. We ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.
  3. MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import. It shows up in the popup but not in the final scene. Owner issue?? Is it related to the fake_joints? The glb here should have a spinning diamond and two spinning skinned cubes:" https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/845433592888557568/MeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3.glb

It seems that all that was needed was to transform the "tip" and "target" headings of an IKBoneChain by the inverse transform of the root. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/841673340740829234/unknown.png 🌅 (1)

- 2021-05-10 17:21:03Z fire: Evaluated EWBIK with Motion Retargeting. Suggestions included adding a position indication (with scale) as a child of the correction node that is a child of the bone attachment and olving only one frame at a time. No conclusions yet, because ewbik is too broken.
- 2021-05-10 02:48:21Z fire: Working with Eron on ewbik. Next meeting at 9am or later.
- 2021-05-09 22:31:35Z fire: Working out a system where we create targets from the other skeletal animation using bone attachments and then a corresponding correction node underneath it. The ik solver then uses those correction node targets as the target.

- 2021-05-08 06:28:45Z lyuma: "1. We set up a matrix server in 5 hours (a few hours wasted due to firewall).

2. We set up federation to the matrix server in an SRV record
   Next steps?
1. Try godot-matrix to see if we can use the matrix server for interop. (Are there similar bindings for other languages?)
1. See if we can boil everything down to be easy to set up.
1. What is matrix actually useful for? Identity? Establishing E2E messages? Sending invites? How does federation help?"

- 2021-04-30 06:47:12Z fire: Lyuma — MaterialX in glTF would allow for a generalization of "KHR_materials_variants" extension - in other words, MaterialX would allow for character or object customization to textures baked at load time
- 2021-04-30 06:06:58Z fire: Made a proposal for GLTF2 to include MaterialX in three stages. A stage 0 extension where it replaces png and a stage 1 extension that replaces gltf variants for parameters, stage 2 would be adding arbitrary graphs as parameters.

- 2021-04-28 01:35:29Z lyuma: The current architecture only allows 100% weight paint to a single bone at a time, and this can cause a seam to appear on softbody meshes
- 2021-04-28 01:34:43Z lyuma: While usability is nice to have, my interest is specifically in revising the underlying architecture of Softbody weight painting as the current storage format is resource intensive and not sufficiently flexible for my needs.

Talked about vertex painting in godot and トカゲ's bone subgizmos needing coordination with Reduz and JFons. Talked about gltf2 having quads but too difficult to get into both blender, godot and gltf. This came up because I and Pouley worked on subdivision surfaces and how they break for uv mapped triangular meshes on the seams.
