## Cybernetic Charm: A Tale of Magic and Technology - MVP Demo

### Main Character: Elysia

Elysia is a high school student with a passion for technology. She has the unique ability to transform into her digital avatar - LuminNet.

### The Plot

In a world where society uses digital avatars in a vast cyber network, Elysia stumbles upon a dormant program that awakens to become LuminNet. Together, they uncover a plot to infect the cyber network with a devastating virus.

### Transformation into LuminNet

When it's time for battle, Elysia transforms into LuminNet. This transformation changes Elysia from her human form into a radiant digital entity.

```markdown
Transformation Sequence:

1. Elysia initiates the transformation process.
2. Her physical form digitizes, becoming a stream of data.
3. This data stream merges with LuminNet, completing the transformation.
```

### Powers as LuminNet

As LuminNet, Elysia can manipulate data to create shields and launch energy blasts. She can also purify corrupted data, making her an invaluable asset against viruses.

Her ultimate attack, "Datastream Deluge", channels the raw power of the network into a massive wave of energy.

## Combat Mechanics

In "Cybernetic Charm", combat takes place on a 2x2 grid. This setup allows for strategic depth in battles but reduces the complexity of the game system.

### Battle System

The battle system is a turn-based strategy format. With the 2x2 grid, positioning and movement become crucial elements of strategy.

```markdown
Battle System Flow:

1. Elysia selects an action (Move, Attack, Defend).
2. LuminNet performs the selected action.
3. The enemy reacts and counters.
```

### Grid-Based Combat

On the 2x2 grid, each cell can be occupied by either LuminNet or an enemy, or remain empty. LuminNet and enemies can move to any adjacent cell, attack enemies within range, or use abilities.

Here's an example of what the battlefield might look like:

```
L = LuminNet
E = Enemy
X = Empty Cell

LuminNet's Grid:
L X
X X
```

"Cybernetic Charm" offers a unique blend of turn-based strategy and RPG elements, making each battle a test of both tactical skill and quick decision-making.

## Arc Menu Feature: Spell Selection

In "Cybernetic Charm", LuminNet has a variety of spells at her disposal. To make these spells easily accessible during combat, an arc menu feature is implemented.

### The Arc Menu

The arc menu, also known as radial or pie menu, is a circular contextual menu where selection depends on direction. It's a compact and efficient way of presenting multiple options, perfect for quick spell selection in the heat of battle.

```markdown
Arc Menu Structure:

1. Open Arc Menu (Press designated button)
2. Navigate through Spells (Move joystick or cursor in the direction of the desired spell)
3. Select Spell (Release button)
```

### Spell Selection

When Elysia transforms into LuminNet, she gains access to her spell arsenal. These spells are categorized and arranged in the arc menu based on their type and power level. For example, defensive spells like shields and healing abilities might be grouped together, while offensive spells like energy blasts could be in another section.

Here's an example of what the arc menu might look like:

```markdown
Arc Menu Layout:

  Shield   Heal
     \     /
      \   /
Energy Blast
```

Each spell in the arc menu has a unique icon and color coding for easy identification. Hovering over a spell reveals a tooltip with more information about the spell, such as its effects, range, and cooldown time.

This arc menu feature allows for quick, intuitive spell selection, adding another layer of strategy to the game's combat system.
