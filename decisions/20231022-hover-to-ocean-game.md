# Navigating New Horizons: A Proposal for Expanding Exploration in V-Sekai

## Metadata

- Status: Proposed

## The Backdrop

In the proposed journey, the player starts with a hovercar and uses an upgrade to transform it into a hover submarine for the ocean exploration part of the journey. This involves navigating through surreal landscapes, encountering storms, avoiding volcanic eruptions, exploring coral reefs, and finally reaching a new island.

## The Challenge

The main challenge lies in seamlessly transitioning from land to underwater exploration while maintaining an engaging and immersive experience for the player. Additionally, creating diverse and interactive environments such as the cyber surrealist/impressionist voxel blocks landscape and the vibrant coral reef poses its own set of challenges.

## The Strategy

To overcome these challenges, we can leverage advanced game development techniques and tools. For instance, we can use voxel-based rendering for creating the surreal landscapes and procedural generation for creating diverse marine life in the coral reef.

For the transition from hovercar to hover submarine, we can design a special animation sequence that showcases the transformation while also preparing the player for the change in gameplay mechanics.

## The Upside

Successfully implementing this would result in a unique and engaging gaming experience that combines elements of exploration, adventure, and survival. It would also showcase the capabilities of V-Sekai in creating diverse and immersive virtual worlds.

## The Downside

The main downside is the complexity involved in implementing the proposed features. It would require significant resources and expertise in various areas of game development. There's also a risk that the final product may not meet the expectations due to technical limitations or unforeseen challenges.

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative approach could be to simplify the journey by limiting the number of environments or removing the transformation aspect. However, this would likely result in a less engaging and immersive experience for the player.

## The Infrequent Use Case

The proposed journey could also serve as a template for creating other similar journeys in different settings or with different vehicles. This would increase the replayability of the game and provide more value to the players.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this proposal aligns with the core values of V-Sekai and can be implemented by our team with the right resources and planning.
