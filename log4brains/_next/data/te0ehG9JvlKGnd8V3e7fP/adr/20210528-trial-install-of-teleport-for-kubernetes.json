Networking is hard, storage creation is hard and the number of steps is not split between config and install.\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nTeleport claims to be a easy to prepare system for preinstalled and airgapped Kubernetes systems.\n\n## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nCreate a prototype for a toy problem.\n\nThe toy problem is serving the shader motion html/js static website as a Kubernetes application.\n\nEvaluate the complexity.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Increase quality of life\n- Easier distributon\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Another layer of complexity\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nKubernetes is a massive project.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis is an attempt to use off the shelf tooling.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://gravitational.com/"},"creationDate":"2021-05-29T00:15:51.000Z","lastEditDate":"2021-05-29T00:15:51.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"K.
