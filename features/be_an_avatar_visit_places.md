# Be an avatar and visit places

V-Sekai allows you to import worlds and explore them.

To learn how to import worlds and visit them, please refer to our documentation or reach out via our community channels.

V-Sekai supports VRM avatar files, an open-source standard for sharing portable humanoid avatars across virtual reality platforms.

Users can personalize their avatars in V-Sekai by importing models from Blender or VRoid Hub and using them as their persona within the virtual space.
