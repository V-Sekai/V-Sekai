"Skill gates" are a unique feature in the game that serve as checkpoints. These gates are strategically placed throughout the game's levels and require players to demonstrate a specific skill they've learned in order to progress.

For instance, if a player has learned a new combat move or magic spell, they might encounter a skill gate where they must use this new ability effectively to overcome an obstacle or defeat an enemy. This not only tests the player's understanding and mastery of the new skill, but also provides a satisfying challenge and sense of progression.
