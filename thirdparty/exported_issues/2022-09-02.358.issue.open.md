### Context and Problem Statement

People are primary to Social VR and not the environment.


### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

VR is social.

What is the environment?

We cannot take people out of the environment?

One observer? Get some value (can touch a friend's blocks but not play)

Two? Blossoms out because now you can synthesize new virtual realities to role-play on the fly through improvisation.

Three? a crowd. Chaotic?

We can not use a head-mounted display, but there is still value.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Pending design.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Option graveyard

_No response_

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is a user story.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Why do we create V-Sekai?

Need to write this as a format proposal because it's an aspiration essay and then close.
