We could make an API where someone or something can post a message to be displayed in discord using curl or some command, though we would have to make sure this is locked behind a secret key. Unclear.\n\n## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Grow the community\n- Help us manage the project\n\n## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Maintenence costs of having a service fed\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nYes, it is possible to script querying the itch.io or uro shards API. The goal of this proposal is to make this information more accessible to whose who would not script it.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nWe need this to grow the community.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://discord.com/\n"},"creationDate":"2021-05-29T18:21:34.000Z","lastEditDate":"2021-05-29T18:21:34.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"K.
