What would a Soriee party map look like? 

Do some concepting.

Use the current placeholder of an apartment.

Have these tools:

1. 3D DCC
2. Material making tools
3. 3d painting mesh tools
4. Clothing design tools

We upgraded unidot and posted a demo of the import.

With an easy-to-use interface, Soriee Party Map will allow you to create a virtual reality party space with your friends. You can use 3D digital creator tools to make objects, material making tools to make materials that can be used in your VR world, 3d painting mesh tools to paint on those materials, clothing design tools so you can design clothes for yourself and your friends, and finally a vr party where you can interact with each other's avatars.

I'm going to post this summary and then postpone the idea.
