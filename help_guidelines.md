#  Help us write about V-Sekai

* We are looking to make complete documentation for the developers and users.
* We have a list of features we need to cover already.
* Write as efficiently as possible to immediately create all the draft pages, one for each significant feature or topic we need to cover. Every prominent feature requires at least an introduction, so it needs a corresponding page with a descriptive title.
* On each page, we want to create a bullet list of all the things the user needs to learn to use the feature.

## An example topic

Let's take a topic, for example, Godot XR. The user will need to know:

- What is XR (we can link to a page or briefly explain it)
- What is Godot (if we have covered it already on the previous page, link to that page, and briefly re-explain, e.g. in one sentence)
- How XR works in Godot and how our product uses it
- What people can achieve concretely with that [feature/knowledge on this page]
- What are limitations of the technology [that also affect our product]

Each page's draft should be a bullet list like this. Because then we or the writer instantly knows all the points the page must cover
And it doesn't take very long to write and review those bullet lists 

Last, for all the cases where the user has to follow steps (for example, using an interface), we need to detail each step with the most straightforward words possible. For instance, if they need to click on three buttons, we describe the steps with explicit mentions of the labels as seen in the UI and always use the same verbs, for example: 

## An example instruction 

To change the game's resolution:

1. Open the Project -> Project Settings... menu.
2. In the left column, navigate down to Display -> Window. In the right part of the window, the game's window settings appear.
3. Scroll down to the resolution setting.
4. Click the numbers to change the resolution. The values are in pixels.

When we say reusing the verbs, it's about being consistent, like:

- Click a button
- Open a menu
- Open a file
- Navigate to a tab

It doesn't have to be 100% of the time the same but for instance, for buttons, click and press are well understood, but "use," while correct, maybe a bit harder to parse

Also, changing the phrasing, style, and verbs used throughout our docs adds cognitive load.

Making things simple, explicit, and consistently allows users to focus on the steps and memorize new information.
