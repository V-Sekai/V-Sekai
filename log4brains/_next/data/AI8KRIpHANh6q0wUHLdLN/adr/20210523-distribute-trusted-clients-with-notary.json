Security concerns with trust. We do not control hosting.\n1. Want ability to mirror package sources.\n1. Research use to distribute avatars and worlds\n1. Want something off the shelf\n\n## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nUse the notary system so we can establish trust.\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nWe distribute the notary updater and make it fetch the launcher and V-Sekai.\n\nWe provide a notary server.\n\nWe setup the trust relationship during the install and maintance.\n\n### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Code reviewed and trusted by large corporations (Docker Images) and in safety critial fields (Automobiles)\n- Off the shelf\n\n### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Unknown support costs\n\n## Option graveyard Steam only\n\nSteam provides a distribution network and marketplace.\n\nList the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)\n\n* Third party trust\n\n## Option graveyard Itch.io only\n\nItch.io provides a distribution network and marketplace.\n\nList the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)\n\n* Third party trust\n\n## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot trivial. The documentaion of Notary start by the description of a possible security model and provides several attacks against it.\n\n## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nFrom a security standpoint, we need to ensure that there is a trust between the software we send and the client supply chain to get it.\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- https://github.com/kolide/updater\n- https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary\n- https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md\n"},"creationDate":"2021-05-24T06:25:58.000Z","lastEditDate":"2021-05-24T06:36:06.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"K.
