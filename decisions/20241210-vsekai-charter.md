# Draft: Update V-Sekai Charter to 2024.

## The Context

The Mozilla Builders Summer MVP Lab charter was submitted on June 8, 2020.

## The Problem Statement

We want to update our V-Sekai charter to 2024.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

**A one-line summary of the MVP:**

A customizable and self-hosted virtual reality environment using Godot Engine.

**Description of the product: What will the MVP be in 8 weeks?**

In 8 weeks, our virtual reality app will work with all SteamVR-compatible PC headsets and the Meta Quest VR platform. It will have a social hub with 3D voice chat, real-time body tracking, simple games, physics, and social video viewing.

**Category:**

- Collaboration & Society
- Decentralized Web: YES
- Messaging & Social Networking: YES
- Surveillance Capitalism
- Misinformation & Content
- Artificial Intelligence
- Web Assembly

**Why does your idea matter? How will it help deliver on the full promise of the internet or make the internet more awesome?**

The Internet is about openness and communication. We see virtual reality as a new way to connect people. With the closure of the High Fidelity platform, we need open-source alternatives to the growing number of closed VR platforms.

We are at a point where VR and related tech are advancing quickly. With better game engines, audio and video codecs, faster internet, and more VR hardware, it's the right time to develop an open platform.

We believe in giving power back to individuals through decentralized technology. Our goal is to create a polished, well-functioning service and integrate decentralized authentication and encryption, as well as content distribution technologies like BitTorrent and IPFS.

**Who are your users or potential users?**

We are building this for users of social virtual reality, online collaboration, and communication products. Social VR is growing, and its potential is just starting to be realized.

Even though VR is still new, it has a large potential market, especially with affordable headsets like the Meta Quest. For example, VRChat has between 12,000 and 15,000 concurrent users, with about 4,000 using VR in 2019.

**What is your connection to the service & the user group you plan to reach with your product?**

We're a team of VR enthusiasts who work on visual effects, level design, and graphics in our spare time.

In a time when connecting at a distance is important, VR can bring people together in a shared space better than video calls. One of our team members has participated in Virtual Market 4, a growing virtual content marketplace.

Other social VR platforms have allowed us to engage with people worldwide, attend live events, and form friendships. We want to enable these experiences in an open and accessible setting.

**Will your team still work on this project if we do not fund it? To what extent?**

Without funding, we will continue to work on it in our spare time, but other closed platforms are catching up, and time is crucial.

**Why did you pick this idea? Would you happen to have domain expertise? How do you know people need what youâ€™re building?**

We see a need for an open alternative to closed VR platforms. Many VR platforms are free now, but there's no guarantee they will stay that way. Our platform can be self-hosted, used privately, and modified.

Our team has experience in backend operations and working with Godot Engine, which is relevant to building this platform.

**Are you looking for any teammates? If so, please indicate what skills or roles you seek.**

We have a Discord group, a GitHub repository, and an issues list where we can post about the project and look for teammates.

**Could you describe your work plan?**

**How will you attract your first 1000 users? Your first 1,000,000?**

We will start with contacts from our VR communities to get the first 50 users. To get more users, we will offer unique experiences not available on other platforms. To reach thousands of users, we will host events and ensure privacy and self-hosting capabilities.

**First 2-week development milestone**

**First two weeks:**

- Maintain continuous integration of Windows SteamVR, Meta Quest, and Linux server builds.
- VOIP implementation: basic lipsync based on volume, and spatialization library integration.
- Improve Inverse Kinematics implementation and add non-VR support.
- Headless clients will stress test the system.
- Implement crash reporting system and performance metrics.
- Content: Use a basic scripting API to implement physics-based games.
- Work on engine changes for smooth frame rates during content loading.

**Tech stack you plan to use (Cloud services, APIs, mobile platforms, languages, etc)**

Godot Engine, k3s, Elixir, OAuth, CockroachDB, Nginx, Fedora, CentOS 8, Digital Ocean Spaces, Meta Quest SDK on Android, Valve OpenVR on Windows.

**Link to simple sketches (can be as simple as paper and pencil) of your product or idea**

Most Social VR applications are being developed in Unity, leading to design challenges. Social platforms are strongly impacted by the network effect, which challenges acquisition. VR applications tend to have low retention compared with conventional applications.

**What challenges do you anticipate with this idea?**

**Will all team members commit their full-time energy to this project during the 8 weeks of the program?**

Not all successful MVP applicants will, but we expect a significant commitment to the MVP Lab. Please explain if you cannot commit full-time to this and how we can be sure this will be a very serious commitment by you and your team.

MMMaellon is making individual contributions, including a VR character movement system, that have proved extremely valuable, as needed.

Saracen will be working full-time on the core client written for Godot.

Lyuma will work full-time on this project, starting with the MVP Lab, focusing on dev ops, operations, backend, and testing.

iFire is heavily engaged with the wider open-source community surrounding Godot Engine and takes on projects that help further Godot as an ecosystem. In addition, it spends part-time dedicated to this MVP project.

**How did you hear about the MVP Lab?**
