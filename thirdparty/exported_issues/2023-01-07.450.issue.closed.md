### Describe the proposed feature and how it helps to overcome a problem or limitation

Godot Engine editor can sometimes crash. However, we don't get a report because Godot Engine organization is not allowed to use crashdata collection due to policy.

Working on V-Sekai.

### If known, describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams
