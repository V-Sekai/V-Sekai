# Sell a Generative Assistant Screen

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: `V-Sekai`

## The Backdrop

V-Sekai is a platform that allows for the creation of generative AI using the Godot engine. This AI can be displayed on a device with an OLED display and incorporates various sensors and a posing compute module. There is also direct support for importing VRM1 avatars.

## The Challenge

The main challenge lies in the use of GGML for both conversation interactions (openllama) and voice commands (whisper). The goal is to create a digital assistant similar to Siri, but the complexity of game development presents significant hurdles.

## The Strategy

The proposed strategy is to focus on using GGML, excluding Python. This approach will require a deep understanding of GGML and its applications in creating interactive and responsive AI.

## The Upside

The upside is the potential creation of a unique digital assistant that leverages the power of generative AI. This could revolutionize the way we interact with technology and open up new possibilities in the field of AI.

## The Downside

The downside is the complexity and difficulty of the project. It requires a high level of expertise and knowledge in several areas including GGML, Godot engine, and AI development.

## The Road Not Taken

One possible path that was considered but not pursued was the integration of Python alongside GGML. While Python is a powerful and versatile language that could have added more flexibility to the project, it was ultimately decided that focusing solely on GGML would allow for a more specialized and optimized system. Another road not taken was to use a pre-existing AI framework instead of building one from scratch. This could have saved time and resources, but it would have limited the customization and unique features of our digital assistant.

## The Infrequent Use Case

This project may not be suitable for those who are not familiar with GGML or do not have a background in AI development.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this project will be developed by us, leveraging our expertise in AI and game development.
