### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,

### Context and Problem Statement

We would like to visualize metrics in-game.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Port https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts to v-sekai

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

1. Create a project in 4
2. Add easy charts as a addon
3. Use the auto migrate in 4
4. Fix missing

### Positive Consequences

We are able to use V-Sekai easier to debug.

### Negative Consequences

We cannot get other features in.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Easy charts is not a few lines of script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Too low performance impacts usability.
