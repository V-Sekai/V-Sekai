### Context and Problem Statement

We want to align collaboration of a XR stage by dividing into layers.

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Given a multiple editors it would be helpful to see the shadows of other rooms so they can be aligned.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

* Each room has a shadow
* When a shadow is activated it is read-only
* Can be delayed

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Mixer is not a trivial project.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is a proposal to the mixer community.
