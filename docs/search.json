Each feature requires a dedicated page with a descriptive title and a bullet list of essential points the user needs to learn.\n\n\nFor instance, when writing about Godot XR, the user should learn:\n\nWhat is XR (link to a page or provide a brief explanation)\nWhat is Godot (link to a previous page if covered, and briefly re-explain in one sentence)\nHow XR works in Godot and how our product utilizes it\nConcrete achievements possible with this feature/knowledge\nLimitations of the technology affecting our product\n\nDraft each page as a bullet list like this, allowing writers to quickly understand the points to cover.\n\n\n\nFor cases where users need to follow steps, detail each step using straightforward language. Be consistent with verbs and phrasing to minimize cognitive load. For example:\n\n\n\nOpen the Project -&gt; Project Settings… menu.\nNavigate to Display -&gt; Window in the left column. The game’s window settings appear on the right.\nScroll down to the resolution setting.\nClick the numbers to change the resolution (values are in pixels).\n\nConsistently use verbs like:\n\nClick a button\nOpen a menu\nOpen a file\nNavigate to a tab\n\nKeeping things simple, clear, and consistent makes it easier for users to concentrate on the process and remember new details.\n\n\n\n\nThis page was written with advice from gdquest."

Key highlights include updates to the godot-vrm repository, security improvements in the v-sekai-game repository, and progress on animation retargeting and PMX character structure. Additionally, a fix was implemented for Skeleton3D’s rest_dirty reset issue.\n\nFork created: aaronfranke/godot-vrm (01/06/2023)\nNew commits in V-Sekai/godot-vrm repository, including updates to load_at_runtime_scene for 4.x and adding files_dropped functionality (02/06/2023)\nPR 130 closed, bumping github/codeql-action from 2.3.5 to 2.3.6 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nPR 129 closed, bumping actions/setup-dotnet from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nStepSecurity bot opened PR 131 to apply security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to avoid the empty avatar crash (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error (02/06/2023)\nNew tag created in V-Sekai/godot: groups-4.x.2023-06-03T034215Z (02/06/2023)\nPR 131 closed, applying security best practices in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to make joining a server less crashy (02/06/2023)\nNew commit in v-sekai-game:main to remove debug points (02/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: codeql (02/06/2023)\nPR 132 opened, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (02/06/2023)\nNew comment on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing how to make a VRM model pose using GDScript (02/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including changes to assert and early return print _error part 3, avoiding runtime errors, and removing gut (02/06/2023 - 03/06/2023)\nPR 132 closed, creating codeql.yml in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nPR 133 opened, hardening GitHub Actions in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game (03/06/2023)\nNew comments on issue #25 in V-Sekai/godot-vrm discussing animation retargeting and PMX character structure (03/06/2023)\nNew commits in v-sekai-game:main, including removing hardcoded gravity and gravity direction, inverting state machine condition, and setting up work in progress state chart (03/06/2023)\nNew branch created in V-Sekai/v-sekai-game: state-chart (03/06/2023)\nSkeleton3D now correctly resets rest_dirty only after all bone transforms have been updated (PR 78025 by lyuma).

The frame times, or the speed at which frames are processed, seemed to be slower than expected. However, it was clarified that these tests were being run in a mode designed for finding errors (debug mode), not for optimal performance.\n\n\n\nThe team discussed how their system’s performance stacks up against other virtual reality social platforms. They used different types of hardware for these comparisons, similar to comparing the performance of different cars using various types of roads and conditions.\n\n\n\nThe team also talked about how to best optimize their system for different devices. This is akin to tuning a car’s engine differently depending on whether it’s going to be driven in the city or on a racetrack.\n\n\n\nThere were discussions about the challenges of rendering avatars, especially when there are multiple avatars on the screen at once. It’s like trying to paint multiple portraits at the same time - the more you have, the harder it gets. The team discussed the need for guidelines to help avatar creators optimize their designs for less powerful hardware.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, the team plans to conduct more tests, particularly focusing on how well their system handles complex 3D models on Android devices. They also aim to create a benchmark scenario where they expect good performance across most platforms, much like setting a standard track to test different cars’ performances."

The problem can be resolved through the device manager.\nRight-click on “Start” (the Windows icon at the corner of your taskbar) and select “Device Manager.”\nWithin the device manager, open the category “System Devices.”\nScroll down to Thunderbolt(TM) Controller - (model number here)\n*Right-click on it, select “Uninstall Device,” and check the box “Delete the driver software for this device.”\nOnce removed, rerun the Thunderbolt installer or the update through the Dell Command Updater.\n*If you are worried about uninstalling the driver in the device manager, fret not. The driver will reinstall itself on reboot if you have an internet connection."

We got quite a lot of demand to make the GLTF importer part of core, given it is needed for VR and other stuff, so I have the feeling we should optimize it for performance (which we should do anyway) and have an option to load actual meshes instead of EditorImporterMesh.. so that means we would need to provide a function to parse the mesh node into a scene node and the editor supplies, otherwise it uses Mesh as a default\n2021-09-07 18:32:54Z fire: Miku Base Textures https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884868837978288178/unknown.png\n2021-09-07 18:02:00Z fire: Miku Miku Dance now split into materials. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884861074648760380/unknown.png 👍 (2)\n2021-09-07 16:39:33Z トカゲ: “fixed skinning https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52462”\n2021-09-07 05:53:14Z fire: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884677671563460639/unknown.png\n2021-09-07 02:10:09Z fire: Trying to write down steps to make a V-Sekai/godot update\n2021-09-06 00:25:10Z fire: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836651615532482611/884232728839606284/kaitai_mmd_pmx.zip\n2021-09-06 00:24:45Z fire: https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/pull/446 Lyuma Thanks to Hakanai I can now generate mmd_pmx c++/stl via & 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\kaitai-struct-compiler\\bin\\kaitai-struct-compiler.bat' --cpp-standard=11 --target=cpp_stl .\\3d\\mmd_pmx.ksy -I=. --cpp-namespace kaitai_mmd_pmx Also glb binary has a parser for read and write too.

Since Godot has no means for preserving the original filename on import when the files are not present, doing a fix to the FBX2glTF tool won’t quite cover my necessary usecase, so I think extracting the map in the tooling is easiest. Will probably revisit this decision later.” 👍 (4)\n\n2021-09-02 01:27:40Z fire: https://twitter.com/babylonjs/status/1433216048036122629?s=20 webgpu\n2021-09-01 21:26:59Z fire: \n2021-09-01 15:39:17Z fire: Tried to get additional screenshots to work https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52316\n2021-09-01 14:53:33Z fire: Worked with ellenhp on a proposal on import, to extract all the vorbis packets and just decode vorbis so the imported file gets rid of the ogg container.

I think we’re going to possibly need two different approaches for solving glTF skeletons.\n\nRadical change to glTF parser to treat all subtree nodes as part of a single skeleton recursively. (What we were just testing) I believe this would be unacceptable in 3.x because it is almost guaranteed to break compatibility with all content, but it may be desirable in 4.x.\nAdd BoneAttachments to skeletons directly parented to skeletons. (We tried this). This may be required in 3.x.\nWhile in _determine_skeletons, detect the specific case in which two skeletons would be directly parented and add them to the disjoint set in this case (look at the parent objects at the end). Do not actully add the parent bone to the disjoint set: only do it if this would hit the problem case. Issue: this may require doing another iteration of the _determine_skeletons code? Is this possible without causing more bugs? This could be a compromise if it is possible.\n\nBugs:\n\nAnimations must not animate SkinnedMesh objects\nWe ran into weird issues with fake_joints. Can these issues be reproduced without the radical change above? I think they can by making a single gltf file which has a skin also referencing a mesh. This issue leads animation targeting mesh-bones to fail to create a bone track correctly.\nMeshSkinnedToItselfAndOthersV3 is missing a whole mesh node after import.

    "text": "V-Sekai is a unique platform that allows you to import and explore various worlds. We’re still working on our documentation, but we welcome contributions and encourage users to reach out to us through our community channels for any questions or assistance.\n\n\n\nCreating Virtual Reality Games with V-Sekai\n\nSupported File Types\nglTF2 Specification\nVirtual Reality Support\nGodot User Tools\nScripting\nSandbox Scripting Environment (WIP)\n\nEmbrace Your Virtual Self with VRM Avatars in V-Sekai\nJourney of Character Avatar Import Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai supports various file types out of the box, including:\n\nAudio: .ogg, .mp3, .wav\nImage: .png, .jpg, .tga, .exr\nText, and more\nRaw 3D Mesh: .obj\n\n\n\n\nWe use the royalty-free 3D content specification, glTF2. It’s easy-to-read JSON format and is extensible with Khronos extension registry on Github. It replaces proprietary FBX and older COLLADA formats and has wide application support (Blender, Godot, etc.). It’s an ISO/IEC 12113 standard and adopted by Unity, Unreal Engine, and other software.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai runs on OpenXR and Vulkan.\n\n\n\nWe provide a file loader for various file types (2D & 3D assets, scenes, scripts, meshes, textures) and editable assets within the editor.\n\n\n\nWe offer a built-in script editor, GDScript: In-house scripting language, GDExtension: C++ binding ABI with cross-version compatibility, and C++ Modules: Native performance.\n\n\n\nWe’re actively researching a security-focused sandboxing environment. You can follow our progress on the godot-wasm project.\n\n\n\nOne of the key features of V-Sekai is its support for VRM avatar files. VRM is an open-source standard designed to enable the sharing of portable humanoid avatars across different virtual reality platforms.\nAs a user, you can personalize your avatars in V-Sekai by importing models from Blender or VRoid Hub. These models then become your virtual persona within the space. For more information on VRM, please refer to VRM: Extending glTF for Portable Humanoid Avatars.\nThe VRM glTF2 extension plays a crucial role in V-Sekai, introducing a host of exciting features. It enables the creation of XR avatars built on glTF, providing an immersive experience for users. The extension also supports automatic humanoid rigging, making it easier to create and control character models.\nInteractive hair and clothing add a touch of realism to the avatars, while twist bones and constraints provide more flexibility in movement and posing. Toon shading with glTF PBR gives the avatars a distinctive visual style, and face shapes for speech allow for more expressive communication within the virtual space.\nCross-engine support ensures that the VRM glTF2 extension can be used across different platforms, enhancing its versatility. The extension also simplifies physics simulation through spring bones, resulting in more natural and fluid movements.

    "text": "One of the key features of V-Sekai is its support for VRM avatar files. VRM is an open-source standard designed to enable the sharing of portable humanoid avatars across different virtual reality platforms.\nAs a user, you can personalize your avatars in V-Sekai by importing models from Blender or VRoid Hub. These models then become your virtual persona within the space. For more information on VRM, please refer to VRM: Extending glTF for Portable Humanoid Avatars.\nThe VRM glTF2 extension plays a crucial role in V-Sekai, introducing a host of exciting features. It enables the creation of XR avatars built on glTF, providing an immersive experience for users. The extension also supports automatic humanoid rigging, making it easier to create and control character models.\nInteractive hair and clothing add a touch of realism to the avatars, while twist bones and constraints provide more flexibility in movement and posing. Toon shading with glTF PBR gives the avatars a distinctive visual style, and face shapes for speech allow for more expressive communication within the virtual space.\nCross-engine support ensures that the VRM glTF2 extension can be used across different platforms, enhancing its versatility. The extension also simplifies physics simulation through spring bones, resulting in more natural and fluid movements. Meta-information such as author and license details can be included, and custom facial expressions or morphs can be created for a personalized touch.\nAnimation retargeting is another feature that enhances the user experience in V-Sekai.

    "text": "VRCX is an assistant application for VRChat that provides a more convenient way to manage various aspects of VRChat than relying solely on the VRChat client (desktop or VR) or website. It also includes several other useful features.\nTo get started with VRCX, download and run the latest installer (VRCX_Setup.exe) from here.\nVRCX offers a wide range of features:\nFriend, World, and Avatar List Management: Manage your friends list, world/group/avatar lists outside of VRChat. Monitor the world/avatar activity of your friends and check their online status. Keep track of when you first added them and when you last saw them. See how much time you’ve spent together in worlds and how many times. Keep track of friend name changes. Save notes to help remember how you met.\nAutomatically Launch Apps When You Start VRChat: You can configure VRCX to launch other apps when you start VRChat. For example, you could have VRCX launch an OSC app or a voice changer app when VRChat opens up.\nWorld Persistence: For worlds that support the feature, VRCX can save world settings, save states, inventories, and other data! Note: To use this feature, you must have “Allow Untrusted URLs” enabled in your VRChat settings. For Developers: Wiki Page - World Persistence (PWI)\nSearch for Avatars, Users, Worlds, and Groups\nBuild a Local, Unrestricted World Favorites List\nStore World Data in the Pictures You Take In-Game\nMonitor/Respond to Notifications: You can send/receive invites and friend requests from VRCX as well as see the instance info of invites that you receive.\nSee Stats/Players for Your Current Instance\nSee the Links to Videos and That Are Playing in the World You’re In\nImproved Discord Rich Presence: You can optionally display more information about your current instance in Discord. World integration for popular worlds like PyPyDance, LSMedia, Movies&Chill and VRDancing. This includes the world thumbnail, name, instance ID, and player count, depending on your settings and whether the lobby is private. You can also add a join button for public lobbies!\nVR Overlay with Configurable Live Feed of All Supported Events/Notifications\nUpload Avatar/World Images Without Unity\nManage and Edit Uploaded Avatar/World Details Without Unity\nAutomatically Restart and Join Last Instance When VRC Crashes\nExport/Import Favorite Groups\nFor those who want a new look for VRCX, check out Themes. Instructions on how to build VRCX from source can be found here. For a guide on how to run VRCX on linux, see here.\nScreenshots of VRCX can be found at the following links: Login , 2fa , Feed , GameLog , UserInfo , Friend , World instance , Favorite Friend , World , Avatar , Friend Log , Discord Rich Presence .\nVRCX is not against VRChat’s TOS. It is an external tool that uses the VRChat API to provide its features. It does not modify the game in any way, only using the API responsibly. It is not a mod, cheat, or any other form of game modification. For VRChat’s stance on API usage, see the #faq channel in the VRChat Discord.\nVRCX is not endorsed by VRChat and does not reflect the views or opinions of VRChat or anyone officially involved in producing or managing VRChat properties.

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai currently has limitations when it comes to creating avatars with specific features and customizations. This can be a hindrance for users who want to have more control over the appearance of their avatars. To address this, we propose an enhancement that introduces various tools and techniques to overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive avatar creation process.\n\n\n\nHere is a list of raw processes to be broken down.\n\n\n\nSource: The source will provide the initial avatar model and any additional assets required. The input mime type for the source could be application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json if the avatar is in GLTF format, or image/png or image/svg+xml if the avatar is provided as a 2D image.\nFilter: The filter will handle all the customization steps mentioned above. It will take the input from the source and apply the necessary modifications to create the desired avatar. The input mime type for the filter would be the same as the output mime type of the source, depending on whether the avatar is in GLTF format or represented as an image.\nSink: The sink will receive the customized avatar from the filter and store it as the final output. For this project, the sink should support both PNG and SVG images for 2D avatars, and GLTF for 3D avatars. Therefore, the output mime types for the sink would be image/png or image/svg+xml for 2D avatars, and application/gltf+json or model/gltf+json for 3D avatars.\n\nNote: To avoid lossy formats, we are using PNG or SVG for 2D images and GLTF for 3D formats. PNG and SVG are lossless image formats, while GLTF is a lossless 3D format that preserves the fidelity of the avatar model.\n\n\n\nHere are the converted inputs and outputs in the xstate format for each step:\n\nImporting the avatar into Godot Engine and “Project Mirage”:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nRefining the imported avatar:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nConverting spring bone to physical simulation bones and colliders:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: assetpackage file\n\nAddressing painting errors:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nChoosing a material:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nResolving issues with materials and bones:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nCorrecting colors and addressing pleated folds:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nCreating complex geometric structures:\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm file\n\nUtilizing Vroid Hub’s hair painter and mesh generator:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .vrm enhanced data\n\n\nAdding facial expressions for motion capture:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: .gltf motion capture data\n\n\nSetting up motion capture:\n\n\nInput: .vrm file\nOutput: vrm animations data stored as .gltf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers will be able to create highly customizable avatars with specific features.\nThe avatar creation process will be enhanced with a variety of tools and techniques.\nDetailed customization of colors, clothing, accessories, and facial expressions will be possible.\nMotion capture capabilities can be integrated for more realistic animations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation process is complex and may require advanced technical skills from users.\nSome steps, like creating a 3D model of the back of the avatar, may not always be successful.\nPainting errors and other imperfections may remain in the final avatar.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcessive complexity or technical requirements: We want the avatar creation process to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, so any options that require advanced technical skills or have excessively complex customization controls will not be included.\n\n\n\n\nNo, the proposed enhancement involves a multi-step process that cannot be easily replicated with just a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nThe proposed enhancement addresses the limitations in V-Sekai’s avatar creation process, providing users with a comprehensive solution for creating highly customizable avatars. By implementing these tools and techniques within the platform, V-Sekai can offer a more robust and user-friendly experience for its community.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

Vargrant is not the status quo.\n\nProxying\nSome udp based proxying methods are known\n\nhttps://github.com/yyyar/gobetween for standalone\ncillium for kubernetes\nWebRTC ice, stun, turn\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nV-Sekai Developers\nWe package V-Sekai in Soiree party mode.\n\nWe start a single server of CockroachDB SQL database and not the default 3 server mode.\nWe provide installs of the Godot game engine client and server.\nWe re-arrange our elixir application Uro to work as a Sandstorm.io application.\n\n\n\nV-Sekai Packages\n\nV-Sekai provides a Server Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Client Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\nV-Sekai a Uro Download Package connecting via PowerBox.\n\nThere is an open question if V-Sekai sandbox design works with powerbox.\n\n\nPlayer and Hosts\n\nIndividual hosts of Sandstorm.io can start their own grains of V-Sekai in Soiree mode.\nPlayers download the Godot Engine client and play.\n\n\n\nHosts\n\nMust provide a way to access the Godot Engine server and the Sandstorm server.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nIt is not trivial and not a few lines to implement a distributed system for a developer.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nSelf-hosted is a feature.\nWe can use Soiree Party mode to test V-Sekai.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nMaybe too complicated for the developers.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe are investigating how to implement the Soiree Party mode.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.cockroachlabs.com/\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/uro\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/powerbox/\nhttps://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/services/\nhttps://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm\nhttps://github.com/mrmetaverse/soiree\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The main components contributing to the computational complexity are:\n\nDelay Lines: Each delay line requires memory for storing the delayed samples and computations for updating the delay buffer. For 8 delay lines, the complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nMatrix Mixing: The mixing matrix combines the outputs of the delay lines in a specific way to create the desired reverb effect. For an 8x8 matrix, there are 64 multiplications and 56 additions required for each sample.\nFeedback and Input/Output Processing: Additional processing, such as filtering or gain adjustments, may be applied to the input, output, or feedback paths. This complexity depends on the specific filters or processing used but is generally proportional to the number of delay lines.\n\nOverall, the computational complexity for a medium-quality reverb effect with 8 delay lines is manageable for most modern CPUs and can be efficiently processed in real-time.\n\n\n\nThe I/O complexity refers to the amount of data that needs to be read from and written to memory during the processing of the reverb effect. In the case of an FDN with 8 delay lines, the I/O complexity is mainly determined by:\n\nReading and Writing Delay Line Buffers: Each delay line requires reading and writing operations for updating the delay buffer. The I/O complexity scales linearly with the number of delay lines.\nInput and Output Audio Data: The audio input data must be read, processed, and combined with the output of the FDN to generate the final reverberated audio signal. The I/O complexity for input and output audio data is generally low compared to the delay line buffer operations.\n\nIn summary, implementing a medium-quality reverb effect using an FDN with 8 delay lines has a manageable computational and I/O complexity, making it suitable for real-time processing on most modern hardware."

    "text": "Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: proposed \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nVR Tracker USB dongles need line of sight.\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement. Placed behind the body.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Elbow: Attach a tracker to the left elbow to monitor its angle, speed, and position. This helps improve the accuracy of tracking arm movements during activities like soccer and dancing.\nRight Elbow: In the same way, place a tracker on the right elbow to keep track of its angle, speed, and position. This also enhances the precision of tracking arm movements in sports such as soccer and dance performances.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

This leads to a problem where you can’t administer your own cluster because your root account’s cert is expired. So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this.

So I had to figure out how to fix this.\nFor the most part, the process I came up with matches this more concise post here: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2342#issuecomment-713016341\nFirst approach, how to rotate kube client certificates: Because we need to modify /root/.kube/config, I ran sudo -i to login as a root shell.\n\nmkdir tls and create tls/config.txt with the following lines:\n\n# --------------------- tls/config.txt -----------\n[ req ]\ndistinguished_name                           = req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions                                   = v3_req\nprompt = no\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\norganizationName       = system:masters\ncommonName             = system:admin\n[ v3_req ]\nbasicConstraints                                 = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage                                           = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage                            = clientAuth\n# -------------------------------------------------\n\ncp /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt tls/client-ca.crt\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out tls/new-key.pem\nopenssl req -new -key tls/new-key.pem -sha256 -nodes -out tls/new-req.csr -config tls/config.txt\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3000 -in tls/new-req.csr -CA tls/client-ca.crt -CAkey /kube/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.key -set_serial 4294742997922865905 -extensions v3_req -extfile tls/config.txt -out tls/new-client.crt\ncat tls/new-client.crt tls/client-ca.crt | base64 -w0; echo\ncat tls/new-key.pem | base64 -w0; echo\nedit .kube/config and update client-certificate-data: and client-key-data: respectively.\n\nHow to upgrade the rest of the certs.\nfind /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls -name '*.crt' | while read fn; do echo $fn ===========; openssl x509 -text -in $fn | grep Not\\ After | grep '202[012]'; done\nHere is the script I ran:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -\nset -x\n[ -e \"$1.csr\" ] || openssl x509 -x509toreq -in \"$1.crt\" -out \"$1.csr\" -signkey \"$1.key\"\nmv -i \"$1.crt\" \"$1.crt.bak.$(date +%s)\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in \"$1.csr\" -CA \"client-ca.crt\" -CAkey \"client-ca.key\" -CAcreateserial -days 3650 -out \"$1.crt\"\ncat \"client-ca.crt\" &gt;&gt; \"$1.crt\"\nyou can use this process to update the client cert for /root/.kube/config\nNote that etcd/client.crt actually uses its own server-ca.key instead of client-ca within the etcd folder, so you need a slight modification of the script for this one. I don’t know what any of these certs do so I just did all of them\nFinally, client-k3s-controller.crt and client-kube-proxy.crt must be copied from /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls to /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent\n\n\n\nStart the upgrade process with:\nsudo dnf upgrade --refresh\nsudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\nsudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34\nAnswer y to all prompts confirming list of packages and new GPG keys, if any. Once successful, it displays:\nDownload complete! Use 'dnf system-upgrade reboot' to start the upgrade.\nTo remove cached metadata and transaction use 'dnf system-upgrade clean'\nThe downloaded packages were saved in cache until the next successful transaction.\nYou can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.\nComplete the upgrade with:\nsudo dnf system-upgrade reboot\nThis will bring the system down for about an hour.\n\n\n\nsudo helm repo update\n# If the stable/nginx-ingress chart is still installed, make sure to helm uninstall nginx first.\nsudo helm upgrade --namespace ingress-nginx nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.replicaCount=2\nsudo helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true\n### I was not able to get external-dns to upgrade, but it is not user-facing so we keep running the old version.\n# sudo helm upgrade external-dns --reuse-values bitnami/external-dns\n\n\n\ncurl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3s/master/install.sh | sh -s - server -o /root/.kube/config --default-local-storage-path /kube/pvc --no-deploy=servicelb --disable=traefik --disable=servicelb\n\n\n\nRun the shell:\nsudo kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public\nAt the top of the shell prompt, it will say something like this. Copy the first two numbers from the CockroachDB CCL line. In this case, 20.2\n#\n# Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.\n# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.\n# To exit, type: \\q.\n#\n# Server version: CockroachDB CCL v20.2.2 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nReplace some.version in the following command with the value we found above:\nSET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.preserve_downgrade_option = 'some.version';\nFinally, perform the upgrade:\nsudo kubectl delete job cockroachdb-init\nsudo helm upgrade cockroachdb cockroachdb/cockroachdb --values cockroachdb.values.yaml\ncurl -o client-secure.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml\nsudo kubectl delete pods/cockroachdb-client-secure\nsudo kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml"

How can we improve the workflow to better maintain the project’s organization and compatibility?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nImplement a Git subrepo management system to separate assets and libraries, enabling easier tracking and synchronization between branches. This solution streamlines the development proces\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\nConfigure the Git subrepo to automatically update and synchronize with the main project.\nUse the Git subrepo in each branch to maintain consistent asset and library versions.\nAvoid storing godot and modules inside of the v-sekai-game.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nImproved organization and compatibility of assets and libraries across branches.\nSimplified workflow for project updates and synchronization.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nPotential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Git subrepo management.\nPossible limitations in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nWorkarounds using scripts may be possible, but they are likely to be less efficient and more prone to errors compared to a Git subrepo management system.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot a few lines of code. It is also devops.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIntegrating a Git subrepo management system as a core feature ensures consistency and maintainability across the entire V-Sekai project. It promotes better collaboration among team members and streamlines the development process.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nGit Subrepo Documentation"

    "text": "Status: draft\nDeciders: V-Sekai, Malek, Lyuma, SaracenOne, Fire,\nTags: Networking,\n\n\n\nWe seek to solve these issues:\n\n(A) Use godot 4.0’s networking tools.\n(B) Use a relay server that doesn’t run any game code, rather than a headless V-Sekai server.\n(C) Make the costs of hosting V-Sekai as small as possible.\n(D) Write the server in Rust, for the speed and safety guarantees.\n(E) Make networking highly scalable for a single server.\n(F) Allow a client to connect to multiple servers simultaneously without issues, for seamless travel and portals.\n(G) Synchronize state between clients\n\nNote: This proposal does not cover Permissions, and is based in part on the previous Entity Networking proposal.\n\n\n\nBy using the technologies described below, we will cover A-G.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce complexity, latency, and processing power, we have created a simple Mastership/Ownership model.\nClients are defined as individuals connecting to a Server, they have their own v-sekai game instance running.\nThe Relay Server, as of now, does not contain information about the state of the world, the only information the Relay Server contains is on Mastership/Ownership rules.\nP1 connects to the Server.\n\nP2 connects to the Server.\n\nP3 connects to the Server.\n\nP1 spawns in a Ball.\n\nServer marks that P1 has both Mastership and Ownership of Ball.\n\nServer synchronizes with P1 and sends the state of the Ball to P2, its location, rotation, the very fact of its existence, and its owner, master, and rule.\n\nServer State\n\n\n\nObjects\nMaster\nOwner\nRule\n\n\n\n\nBall\nP1\nP1\nAsk\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n\nSince P1 is the Owner of the Ball, this means that P1 is the only one who can change the state of the ball. When Server synchronizes, if P2 were to have the ball in a different location then P1, the Server would tell P2 that the Ball is in the location P1 has it, and would do the same for P3. It can be thought of as a mutex on the state of the Ball. Whoever holds the Mutex is the one who can modify the state therein. This also means that all calculations for game state are split up among all the players, every player only has to run code modifying what they own, which in large scale player events would otherwise increase exponentially with custom scripts for each player’s props or avatars.\n\n\n\nThis presents a problem however, how could P2 take the Ball from P1? The solution is Mastership. Whoever is the Master can change who is the Owner at any time. The Master also can change whatever the default Rule is, which is what the Server, and Client references when looking to change Ownership to itself (or someone else?).\n\nAsk: Take a round trip to the Master and back to the Server so the Master can decide based on external factors whether or not to allow ownership transfer or deny it. This could be used for example, if someone only wants a gun to be grabbable if they are a “shooter” and not if they are a “civilian”\nDeny: You cannot ask for ownership transfer, good for things like Avatar’s transform node, you don’t wanna be involuntarily moved around, or for the root of the world map.\nAllow: You can ask for ownership any time, and it is automatically granted.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the rate of synchronization based on the closest clients owned model, and other things like that, there are a lot of areas for optimization when it comes to using this.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Latency for Competitive/Real-Time interactions\nLow processing power on both the server and client side\nBroad enough to be easily modifiable for optimizations in the future without changing the model\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity, we will have to code this all from scratch basically\nMulti-user interactions become impossible on a single object, at least to do simply, some smart coding could get around it but it isn’t easy to do.\nResolutions for the allow rule could lead to inconsistencies, such as two different people picking up a gun and firing it, and two resulting bullets being spawned from the same gun before it gets removed from one individual.\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely, this is the foundation of basically everything content wise in V-sekai.\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/blob/master/decisions/2020/20200729-entity-networking.md\nMalek’s forum post on networking in the Discord server.\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This screen will be displayed until all the assets needed to load your world have been downloaded.\nWhen switching between worlds, there is technically no need for a loading screen. Both leading platforms have chosen to include one in their applications, but this is not necessary. The leading platform displays a loading screen when clicking to go to a new world, while the secondary leading platform does not display one–you stay in your original world while also loading into the second world and then switch over once enough of it has been downloaded that you can be there.\nYou click go and are left in your current world while loading in the other world, once the other world is completely loaded in you are transported to it instantaneously.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nAble to mask loading times\nAble to direct players to the positive parts of v-sekai\nFor style points we could enforce portals that seamlessly transport you between different worlds, at least, as the default option, you place a portal, it has a camera, and you can walk through it, and after a certain point it disappears.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\ncoordinating cats\nThe drawback to the multi-world load is that it is more resource intensive, though it should only last a short while, so if we do go that route it should be an option to use a loading screen instead.\nIt makes for a far less friction-less experience\nBut again, resource intensive issues, so will have to be optional\nWe could even add a little button you click once you are ready to be transported, so it doesn’t happen against your will if your trying to say something last minute.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNot script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWorld traversal is a problem.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018-present SaracenOne\nCopyright (c) 2019-present K.

Utilize the Vulkan backend to run an image superresolution demo that generates 4x larger images. IREE is an MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a unified IR, allowing for better performance and scaling.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nCompile IREE as a C++ GDExtension for Godot Engine 4.0.\nUse the Vulkan backend to run the image superresolution demo.\nLoad and process ML models for image superresolution using IREE.\nIntegrate the resulting functionality into V-Sekai’s existing image processing pipeline.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nAllow image superresolution in V-Sekai.\nEnhanced performance due to IREE’s efficient MLIR-based compiler and runtime.\nScalable solution that adapts to various hardware and software constraints. Not only NVIDIA, but ARM, Intel, AMD and Apple gpus.\nAllow using other machine learning models from PyTorch and Tensorflow\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nAdditional development time required for integration and optimization.\nPotential trade-offs in implementing other features.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse a custom script to work around the image superresolution issue.\n\nThis might not provide a scalable or high-performance solution.\n\nImplement a different image superresolution algorithm.\n\nThis could lead to suboptimal results compared to IREE’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nA custom script could serve as a workaround for infrequent use of image superresolution, but it may have drawbacks in terms of efficiency, output quality, and maintenance efforts. If the feature aligns with V-Sekai’s goals and significantly improves user experience, integrating the IREE-based solution into the core might be more effective.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nIn summary, integrating the IREE-based image superresolution feature into V-Sekai’s core offers several benefits, including an enhanced user experience, performance optimization, alignment with open source values, and easier maintenance and support. These advantages contribute to a better, more immersive VR experience while staying true to V-Sekai’s project goals.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai: https://v-sekai.org/\nIREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment): https://github.com/openxla/iree\nGodot Engine: https://godotengine.org\nVulkan Backend: https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/\nIREE.gd: https://github.com/RechieKho/IREE.gd"

    "text": "Status: rejected \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,networking,\n\n\n\n\nOur project involves a distributed simulation system where maintaining strong consistency and efficient workload distribution are important requirements. We are currently facing the challenge of how to handle authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers without incurring high network hop counts and latency.\nSomeone invited me to a popular VR platform and gave me a 20-minute tour, just enough to learn how to in desktop mode create a world, import an object, and inspector-edit it. So I imported our celebration map, and the map loaded in 20 seconds. I was able to change its transform. I’m still thinking about that experience.\n\n\n\nWe propose to use a metadata system with Khepri instances and Raft consensus algorithm to manage ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes. Homeservers will manage metadata using their own Khepri instances within a Raft cluster, while simulation servers, including player simulation servers, will maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer will be initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure will be updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates will be exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nBy monitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers, we can balance the system and ensure fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers will ensure efficient workload distribution and enhance the overall gaming experience.\nWe believe that this approach will provide strong consistency guarantees, access control, and scalability while minimizing network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates between simulation servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeserver: A server responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes.\nSimulation server: A server responsible for containing game entity nodes it has authority over, including player simulation servers.\nKhepri: A tree-like replicated on-disk database library for Erlang and Elixir, used for maintaining a nested path-to-value store.\nRaft cluster: A cluster of servers implementing the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure strong consistency and fault tolerance.\nOwnership: The player who has control over a game entity and can change its state.\nMastership: The authority that can change ownership rules and default ownership settings.\nAsk, Deny, Allow: Rules set by the Master for ownership transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach type of server can only be Khepri members of the same type.\nEach server can only allow be Khepri members of the same logical instance.\nRaft is only active inside of each logical instance.\nHomeserver servers are REST + JSON and the cheap pattern.\nSimulation servers are using the nasty state transfer pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nAction\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to the home server to fetch the public key of Player B.\n\n\n2\nThe home server retrieves Player B’s public key from its database and sends it back to Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n3\nPlayer A’s simulation server uses Player B’s public key to encrypt a message or binary data.\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s simulation server signs the encrypted message or binary data using its own private key.\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends the encrypted message or binary data along with the digital signature to Player B’s simulation server using the membrane_udp_plugin.\n\n\n6\nPlayer B’s simulation server receives the message and verifies the digital signature using Player A’s public key, which it retrieves from the home server.\n\n\n7\nIf the signature is valid, Player B’s simulation server uses its own private key to decrypt the message and obtain the original data sent by Player A’s simulation server.\n\n\n8\nIf the message is confidential, Player B’s simulation server may want to send a response back to Player A’s simulation server using a similar protocol, with Player A’s public key retrieved from the home server.\n\n\n\nThis table outlines the steps of the communication protocol between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers, which involves retrieving public keys from the home server’s database, encrypting and signing messages, and verifying digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of the messages. This protocol ensures secure and confidential communication between the two simulation servers, allowing for safe and reliable data exchange.\n# EC examples\nalice_private_jwk = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-alice.pem\")\nalice_public_jwk  = JOSE.JWK.to_public(alice_private_jwk)\nbob_private_jwk   = JOSE.JWK.from_pem_file(\"ec-secp256r1-bob.pem\")\nbob_public_jwk    = JOSE.JWK.to_public(bob_private_jwk)\n\n## Encrypt and Decrypt (defaults to ECDH-ES with A128GCM)\n### Alice sends Bob a secret message using Bob's public key and Alice's private key\nalice_to_bob = \"For Bob's eyes only.\"\nencrypted = JOSE.JWK.box_encrypt(alice_to_bob, bob_public_jwk, alice_private_jwk)\n### Only Bob can decrypt the message using his private key (Alice's public key is embedded in the JWE header)\n{^alice_to_bob, _} = JOSE.JWK.box_decrypt(encrypted, bob_private_jwk)\n\n\n\nIn a distributed simulation system, maintaining separate roles for homeservers and simulation servers and using a metadata system with strong consistency guarantees is crucial. Homeservers are responsible for managing metadata, including ownership and mastership information for game entity nodes, using a Khepri instance within a Raft cluster. Simulation servers, including player simulation servers, maintain game entity nodes they have authority over using their own Khepri instances.\nAuthority transfer is initiated through the metadata Raft cluster when players interact with game entities governed by different simulation servers. The homeserver Khepri’s nested path-to-value structure is updated based on the ownership and mastership rules set by the Master. State updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.\nMonitoring the load on homeservers and simulation servers allows for balancing the system and ensuring fault tolerance using Raft’s mechanisms. As the number of game entity nodes and players grows, adding more homeservers to the metadata Raft cluster and more simulation servers ensures efficient workload distribution and enhances the overall gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\nCase 1: Authority transfer from Player A to Player B on a different home server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority request to Player B’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s homeserver sends a response to Player A’s homeserver (H hops).\nH\n\n\n4\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends an authority response to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n5\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nSending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server may not be necessary, as the authority request can be sent directly to Player B’s homeserver without waiting for confirmation.\nTotal hops: 3 + 2 * H\nCase 2: Authority transfer if Player A’s and Player B’s homeservers are exactly the same\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends a request to its homeserver (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer A’s homeserver sends a response directly to Player B’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n3\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server (1 hop).\n1\n\n\n\nTotal hops: 3\nIn this optimized process, we have removed sending an acknowledgment from Player A’s homeserver to Player A’s simulation server. This acknowledgment may not be necessary, as the response can be sent directly to Player B’s simulation server without waiting for confirmation. By removing this step, we reduce the total hop count by 1, potentially improving the efficiency of the authority transfer process when both players are on the same home server.\nCase 3: Direct communication between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers on the same home server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an update directly to Player B’s simulation server using a hand-optimized binary layout and an asynchronous communication model.\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server using credit-based flow control or another asynchronous technique.\n1\n\n\n\nIn this modified version of Case 3, both the update and acknowledgment steps employ the high-performance communication system’s features. This includes using hand-optimized binary layouts for data transfer and asynchronous communication techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. The total hop count remains the same at 2 hops.\n\n\n\nStrong consistency guarantees\nAccess control over Khepri instances\nScalability\nMinimized network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity: The proposed system involves multiple components, such as homeservers, simulation servers, Khepri instances, and Raft clusters. Managing and maintaining these components can be complex and may require significant development effort.\nPerformance: The use of Raft consensus algorithm ensures strong consistency but may introduce performance overhead due to the need for communication between nodes in the cluster. This could impact the overall performance of the distributed simulation system.\nScalability: While the proposal aims to provide scalability, it is not clear how well the system will scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows. Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\nSecurity: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers.

This acknowledgment may not be necessary, as the response can be sent directly to Player B’s simulation server without waiting for confirmation. By removing this step, we reduce the total hop count by 1, potentially improving the efficiency of the authority transfer process when both players are on the same home server.\nCase 3: Direct communication between Player A and Player B’s simulation servers on the same home server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nHop Count\n\n\n\n\n1\nPlayer A’s simulation server sends an update directly to Player B’s simulation server using a hand-optimized binary layout and an asynchronous communication model.\n1\n\n\n2\nPlayer B’s simulation server sends an acknowledgment to Player A’s simulation server using credit-based flow control or another asynchronous technique.\n1\n\n\n\nIn this modified version of Case 3, both the update and acknowledgment steps employ the high-performance communication system’s features. This includes using hand-optimized binary layouts for data transfer and asynchronous communication techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. The total hop count remains the same at 2 hops.\n\n\n\nStrong consistency guarantees\nAccess control over Khepri instances\nScalability\nMinimized network hop counts and latency for authority transfer and state updates\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity: The proposed system involves multiple components, such as homeservers, simulation servers, Khepri instances, and Raft clusters. Managing and maintaining these components can be complex and may require significant development effort.\nPerformance: The use of Raft consensus algorithm ensures strong consistency but may introduce performance overhead due to the need for communication between nodes in the cluster. This could impact the overall performance of the distributed simulation system.\nScalability: While the proposal aims to provide scalability, it is not clear how well the system will scale as the number of game entity nodes and players grows. Adding more homeservers and simulation servers might help, but there could still be bottlenecks or limitations that need to be addressed.\nSecurity: The proposed state transfer protocol relies on public key cryptography for secure communication between simulation servers. However, the security of the system depends on proper key management and protection against potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\nFault tolerance: Although the Raft consensus algorithm provides fault tolerance, the system’s resilience to failures (e.g., server crashes, network issues) needs to be carefully considered and tested to ensure smooth operation under various conditions.\nSynchronization: The proposal mentions that state updates are exchanged between old and new authority simulation servers or synchronized using a separate mechanism during authority transfer.

    "text": "Merge retargeting feature into Godot Engine master\n\nDescribe the status of the issue.\nSuperceded by the https://github.com/V-Sekai/V-Sekai.github.io/issues/229 proposal.\n\n\nList the deciders of the issue.\nV-Sekai,tokage,fire,lyuma\n\n\nDescribe the tags of the issue.\nV-Sekai,animation,retargeting,\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nWe want to share animations among different skeletons.\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nUse tokage’s animation retargeting.\n\nLyuma’s explanations\nFirst of all, Local (rest) and Absolute modes are not good enough for most of the common retargeting cases. As a test,. I transferred a local animation from one character to an Xbot model, and the animation was broken. See here: left is Global (GLO) which works well. Right is Local (LOC) which has arms and body backwards (image below).\nSo the question is: when is Global not good enough? Well, it is not well suited for finger bones. By its very nature, it does not know how finger bones work, since it is working on the “silhouette” of the model.\nThis means none of these retargeting modes are good enough on their own. So what can we do about it?\nPerhaps it is possible to create an importer which twists fingers in the Bone Rest matrix into a configuration suitable for Global retargeting? I can’t say whether or not this is possible, but if this could be solved, then maybe we can use Global mode for everything?\nIt could be declared that finger bones shall be local, and all other bones shall be global, and everyone making assets should agree on finger rotations. This might not always be possible, but this is my interpretation of reduz’s idea of storing the PlaybackMode in Node B in Tokage’s diagram.\nOr it could be left up to each animation artist / importer which to use, and then you’re going to have a mixture of modes. If so, I see two ways to deal with it:\nThe animations are stored in global along with skeleton and converted using the source skeleton. This sounds ok in principle if some conversion tool could be made, but I would be afraid to deal with converting animations on the fly at runtime.\nThe animations must point to the RetargetOption they were generated with (or a per-track retarget mode), so that these differently sourced animations can be mixed.\nfrom what I can understand, “2” is what Tokage is proposing. I don’t see many other solutions to this. Fundamentally, if it is the case that animations made from different models are needed to be mixed, I don’t see a viable solution other than the last one.\n\n\n\n158130997-7582d581-2b3c-45f5-b28f-deb26f2f6ffd\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nSee pull request.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nSharing animations will make Godot Engine better.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nThe feature is hard to do.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nUse Blender and other types of retargeting\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNOT A FEW LINES OF SCRIPT!!!\n\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nThis should be a core feature of Godot Engine.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56902\n\n\n\nLicense of the contribution\nCopyright (c) 2022 V-Sekai contributors.

Procedural generation is an algorithmic method of content creation that replaces manual design, resulting in a larger array of unique combinations.\nThe procedural generator can be developed using a mix of algorithms, libraries, and assets to produce a vast assortment of variations for props, environments, and avatars. Users’ input parameters, such as prop type, color, size, and material, will guide the generator in crafting distinctive content.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph TD\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; B(Select Base Model)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; C(Apply Procedural Variations)\n  A[Prop Type] --&gt; D(Combine Variations)\n  B --&gt; E(Base Model)\n  C --&gt; F(Shape Variation)\n  C --&gt; G(Color Variation)\n  C --&gt; H(Texture Variation)\n  F --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  G --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  H --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  E --&gt; I(Combined Variations)\n  I --&gt; J(Final Output)\nThis flowchart demonstrates the procedural generation process using the following steps:\n\nUser Input Parameters: Users provide their preferences for prop type, color, size, and material.\nSelect Base Model: The generator selects a base model corresponding to the chosen prop type.\nApply Procedural Variations: The generator applies algorithmic variations to the base model, modifying its shape, color, and texture based on user input.\nCombine Variations: The generator combines these variations to create a unique prop with the specified properties.\nGenerate Unique Prop, Environment, or Avatar: The final output is a unique prop, environment, or avatar that meets the user’s preferences.\n\nThis approach increases the variety and customization options in V-Sekai, enhancing the platform’s appeal and offering a more engaging experience for users.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEnhanced variety: Procedural generation enables a wide array of unique content, delivering a diverse and constantly evolving experience for users.\nUser personalization: By incorporating user preferences, the generator can produce content that aligns with individual tastes and needs.\nEfficient resource utilization: Procedural content generation minimizes the need for manual design and asset creation, leading to a more cost-effective platform.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nComplexity: Developing a procedural generator can be intricate, necessitating expertise in algorithms, 3D modeling, and other technical domains.\nPerformance impact: Real-time content generation might affect performance, particularly if algorithms are not optimized or if the platform experiences high user traffic.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nDo nothing.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nThis is a few lines of code.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe care about v-sekai more than others.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

It details an AI framework and production pipeline that allow designers to craft huge amount of AI archetypes quickly and flexibly. Next, Genshin’s pathfinding service is introduced, an approach to reduce NavMesh disk and memory space overhead, caused by continuously-growing world map. Finally, this session discusses AI performance optimization and shows how AI system can be modularized and broke down into multi-threaded tasks on CPU.\nEmotional Systemic Facial of ‘Last of Us Part II’ As graphic fidelity in video games has rapidly accelerated, one aspect of development has overwhelmingly remained stagnant; in-game character emotions. In this talk, Naughty Dog explores how they addressed this industry wide limitation in The Last of Us Part II. Represented by team members from character rigging, animation, dialogue, and design; this talk comprehensively covers how character emotion was brought into gameplay ranging from nuanced narrative moments to adrenaline charged melee combat. Learn about the challenges, implementation, and innovation that occurred to develop the systemic emotion system that brought over 65 characters speaking 13 languages with up to 20 individual emotions to life.\nMotion Matching in ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Naughty Dog is known for the animation quality of their titles. For The Last of Us Part II, they decided to take a leap of faith and switch to at that time pretty experimental animation system called Motion Matching. Two Naughty Dog technical animators will tell you the story of initial joy, later frustration and ultimate fear as the development of the new project went on and but not everything went according to plan. Thanks to many clever solution, hard work and a very talented team, Naughty Dog was able to ship a game that was unanimously praised for animation quality among critics and players.\nhttps://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/\nhttps://github.com/deflinhec/GodotGoogleSheet\nhttps://baserow.io/\nhttps://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32408\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This blueprint proposes a method for creating music using computer algorithms.\n\n\n\nThe mission is to create music using computer programs.\n\n\n\nOne promising strategy is to employ .ABC files. These files have proven effective in generating outputs with AI models like GPT-3. The .ABC files carry data in the header section, such as the key signature, tempo, and time signature, which can be incorporated into the prompt.\nAlternatively, we could leverage AI models to script for us. For instance, we could ask for a Python script that composes the chromatic 7th intervals from C to B in eighth notes.

    "text": "VMD on VRM AnimationTree Node\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nEirexe made a VMD player based on Lox’s work.\nThis new ability means we now have a viable way to load VMD motions and use them as a VRM motion player.\n\n\nDescribe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nWe want to make an AnimationTree node to drive Miku Miku VMD motion and add other procedural animation features to blend motion on the VRM Avatar.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\nHowever, we need to make some changes to the AnimationTree UI editor to make the changes possible. We want an expanded AnimationTree to customize nodes, mainly when Godot Engine adds procedural animation features.\nSaracen wants to make sure that the AnimationTree gets the features needed so any custom nodes can be quickly prototyped via scripted extensions if needed. Doing it in purely c++ can limit scripting.\niFire’s “hard coding” definition tests if the node is different from writing the node from a composition of existing nodes. A VMD animation tree node would be “hard coding.”\nThere are currently some limitations with the AnimationTree, which makes the animation tree somewhat challenging to extend with custom nodes via scripting. However, the good news is, we do not think it would take much to make a VMD AnimationTree node work. The AnimationTree work is primarily a UI limitation and a small one at that.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNOT A FEW LINES OF CODE!\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nWe currently know how to do this, if we don’t who else will?\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://github.com/EIRTeam/VMDMotionGD\nhttps://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Be sure nobody else adds any other comments until we begin discussing the cards.\nLast, sort the cards by number of comments (most amount of + go to top) and then one by one drag in the top card to “discussing”. Set a timer for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes the group votes to keep discussing or to move on. While discussing the group can add comments or links to the card while discussing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai, Bioblaze Payne, fire\nTags: V-Sekai, GPT-4\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai is a project that aims to provide an immersive virtual world experience for users. As the project grows in complexity, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the system is thoroughly tested and can handle various scenarios. One of the challenges faced by the V-Sekai team is the lack of diverse and realistic data for testing purposes. This limitation hinders the ability to identify potential issues and optimize the system’s performance.\n\n\n\nTo address the limitations in testing the V-Sekai system due to the lack of diverse and realistic data, this proposal suggests generating random text data for testing purposes.\n\n\nWe will use a tool like Chance.js library to generate random text data for testing purposes and use the database.\n\n\nFor generating random sentences, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.sentence();\nReference: Chance.js Sentence\n\n\n\nFor generating random user names, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.name();\nReference: Chance.js Name\n\n\n\nWe will perform the following SQL operations on the user and chat tables:\n\nSELECT All Data in Table\nSELECT LIKE Data based on %NA%\nSELECT Specific Row Data\nINSERT\nUPDATE\nDELETE\n\n\n\nTable user\nid | username | password | updated_on | created_on |\nTable chat\nid | user_id | name | text | updated_on | deleted_on | created_on |\n\n\n\n\nWe will create a SQL function to check if the username/password match and return ‘OK’. We will also check if the query returned is ‘OK’ and add false information randomly in the nodes to signify a user doing invalid calls for production testing.\nThe implementation will generate 90 days of data, generating 100,000 text data entries for testing purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved testing capabilities with diverse and realistic data\nEnhanced system reliability due to thorough testing\nIdentification of potential issues before they impact users\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional development time required to implement the solution\nPotential increase in storage requirements for generated data\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing static test data: This option was considered for simplicity, but it would not provide the diverse and realistic data needed for thorough testing.\nManual data generation: This option involved manually creating test data, but it was deemed time-consuming and inefficient compared to using a library like Chance.js.\nThird-party data generation services: While there are external services that can generate random text data, using them would introduce dependencies and potential costs. Implementing our a solution similar to Chance.js allows for better control over the process.\nCrowdsourcing test data: This option involved gathering test data from users or volunteers. However, it raised concerns about data privacy, consistency, and quality.\n\n\n\n\nNo, this enhancement is essential for thorough testing and cannot be easily worked around with a few lines of script.\n\n\n\nYes, addressing the V-Sekai limitation is crucial for ensuring the system’s reliability and performance. Implementing this solution internally allows for better control over the testing process and data generation.\n\n\n\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "To address the limitations in testing the V-Sekai system due to the lack of diverse and realistic data, this proposal suggests generating random text data for testing purposes.\n\n\nWe will use a tool like Chance.js library to generate random text data for testing purposes and use the database.\n\n\nFor generating random sentences, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.sentence();\nReference: Chance.js Sentence\n\n\n\nFor generating random user names, we will use something like the following method:\nchance.name();\nReference: Chance.js Name\n\n\n\nWe will perform the following SQL operations on the user and chat tables:\n\nSELECT All Data in Table\nSELECT LIKE Data based on %NA%\nSELECT Specific Row Data\nINSERT\nUPDATE\nDELETE\n\n\n\nTable user\nid | username | password | updated_on | created_on |\nTable chat\nid | user_id | name | text | updated_on | deleted_on | created_on |\n\n\n\n\nWe will create a SQL function to check if the username/password match and return ‘OK’. We will also check if the query returned is ‘OK’ and add false information randomly in the nodes to signify a user doing invalid calls for production testing.\nThe implementation will generate 90 days of data, generating 100,000 text data entries for testing purposes."

    "text": "Using static test data: This option was considered for simplicity, but it would not provide the diverse and realistic data needed for thorough testing.\nManual data generation: This option involved manually creating test data, but it was deemed time-consuming and inefficient compared to using a library like Chance.js.\nThird-party data generation services: While there are external services that can generate random text data, using them would introduce dependencies and potential costs. Implementing our a solution similar to Chance.js allows for better control over the process.\nCrowdsourcing test data: This option involved gathering test data from users or volunteers.

Each stage builds upon the previous one, gradually expanding the project’s scope and capabilities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\n\n  subgraph Short Term\n    A[Avatar Loading] --&gt; B1[Simple Demo with VRM Avatar]\n    A --&gt; B2[VRM & Unity Import - Maintain and Improve]\n    A --&gt; B3[Network Code Reconciliation - Godot Network System]\n    A --&gt; B4[Jitter in Network Interpolation]\n    A --&gt; B5[Implement jitter and playback buffer for Voice]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Mid Term\n    B4 --&gt; C[Network]\n    C --&gt; D1[Entity System & Background Loading]\n    C --&gt; D2[Background Loading - Re-evaluate with Multithreaded Scene Tree]\n    C --&gt; D3[UI Work - Fix VR UI & Improve Interaction]\n    C --&gt; D4[Lightweight Relay Instance Server - Single Process, Multiple Instances]\n  end\n\n  subgraph Long Term\n    D4 --&gt; E[Scalable Instances]\n    E --&gt; F1[Network Topology Implementation]\n    E --&gt; F2[Streamlined Content Creation - Better Workflow]\n    E --&gt; F3[Zero Stutter when Loading Content - Address Bottlenecks]\n    E --&gt; F4[Social and Upload Features - Enhance User Experience]\n    E --&gt; F5[Video and Audio Work - Streaming Integration]\n    E --&gt; F6[Scripting Integrations - WASM-based Scripts]\n    E --&gt; F7[UX Work for Non-Technical Users - Accessible UI]\n    E --&gt; F8[Loading VRM Avatars - Streamlined Process]\n    E --&gt; F9[In-Editor Content Building UX - Non-Technical Users]\n  end\nThe discussion involves the development of V-Sekai, a project with short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. In the short term, the focus is on avatar loading, simple demos, VRM & Unity import, network code reconciliation, adding network interpolation, and voice jitter buffer. Mid-term goals include working on the network, entity system, background loading, UI improvements, and developing a lightweight relay instance server. Finally, long-term goals involve scalable instances, network topology implementation, streamlined content creation, zero stutter loading, enhancing social and upload features, video and music playback and live streaming, scripting integrations, UX work for non-technical users, and in-editor content building UX.\nOne challenge the project faces is maintaining and improving the existing codebase, which includes outdated workarounds from Godot 3. Another setback was the change from OpenVR to OpenXR. Content is another hurdle: transferring a world from other platforms to V-Sekai is currently best accomplished by exporting source assets such as glTF or FBX. The project aims to cater to non-technical users, making it more accessible than other platforms. WASM-based scripting is being considered, but there are concerns about implementation challenges and security.\nIn addition, the V-Sekai project needs a project manager, and the team struggles to find collaborators who share their vision and can dedicate enough time to contribute significantly. Nevertheless, despite the long list of features needed for basic functionality, the team believes that V-Sekai is essential for the future of the Metaverse space, and that will draw collaborators to assist on our common vision.\nIt’s important that our roadmap and goals continue to be discussed and iterated on. Nothing should be seen as final, since technology changes so rapidly and consensus is important.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe can create V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nOverhead might be hard.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nRelying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\nContinuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo. This is a process.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

To boost its functionality and compatibility with other tools, we propose integrating networked procedural generation as a sidecar to the Godot engine server, allowing for more dynamic and immersive environments in V-Sekai.\nTo further address V-Sekai’s limitations, we suggest incorporating the Membrane Framework along with other relevant technologies such as Godot Engine, OpenMfx Support, Elixir Phoenix, and Elixir Nx.

However, its integration with Github may not be as smooth as Zenodo’s.\nManual DOI registration: Manually registering a DOI through agencies like DataCite or CrossRef. This option can be labor-intensive and might involve additional fees.\nDepending on publisher-assigned DOIs: Some publishers allocate DOIs to supplementary materials during article publication. However, this option relies on the publisher’s policies and may not encompass all digital artifacts.\nEmploying institutional repositories: Certain institutions provide their own repositories for hosting digital artifacts and assigning DOIs. This option could be constrained by institutional policies and access limitations.\nNo DOI: Opting not to assign a DOI to V-Sekai’s digital artifacts, which would complicate referencing and long-term accessibility."

There are two variants. One uses a per-pixel linked list (PPLL), and the other uses a multi-pass method referred to as Shortcut.\n\n\nThe main decision to make is whether to use per-pixel linked lists or Shortcut. The Shortcut method can be generally faster, with an easier memory bound, but at the expense of some quality. The TressFX 4.1/Unreal 4.22 Engine integration uses Shortcut (although the shader for PPLL may still be present in the branch, it was/is unmodified/untested/unused). TressFX 4.1/Cauldron uses both Shortcut and PPLL.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nAvatars are a strength of V-Sekai.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nNo response\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nCode complexity.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nReduz isn’t interested in OIT.\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/master/doc/TressFX4xDeveloperGuide.pdf\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXPPLL.hlsl\nhttps://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX/blob/master/src/Shaders/TressFXShortCut.hlsl\nhttps://blog.icare3d.org/2010/07/opengl-40-abuffer-v20-linked-lists-of.html\nhttps://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/oit/oit.cpp\n\n\n\n\nDerivative License\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

A line graph shows the progress of an animation over time, while a scatter plot shows the data points that were used to create an animation.\nA line graph can help you debug physics interpolation issues. If your object’s position is not moving smoothly, you can look at how it moved over time and see if there are any sudden changes or jumps in its motion that might be causing problems. This will help you determine whether you need to adjust your physics simulation or tweak some other aspect of your game design.\nSecond, you can use scatter plots to visualize how different variables interact with each other. For example, if you have an object that’s supposed to move along a straight line but instead moves in a curved path, then it might be helpful for you to see whether there are any correlations between its position and its velocity. This will help you isolate which variables are causing this behavior so that you can optimize them individually or together.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\nWe are able to use V-Sekai easier.\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nWe cannot get other features in.\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nOption: The status quo. \nRejection Reason: This solves nothing. \n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nEasy chart is a gdscript addon but it is not trivial to reimplement.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nMotion posing is a core feature.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nEasy Charts"

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, iPad, Presentation Screen, Compatibility\n\n\n\n\nWe are developing a VR game that MUST be compatible with a wide range of devices. Our goal is to make our VR game accessible and enjoyable for this vast majority of users.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is to ensure the game’s user interface and controls work seamlessly across these different display sizes and touch interfaces.\n\n\n\nWe considered two options: Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices and Navmesh and 3D navigation points. We chose the “Virtual joystick for touchscreen devices” because it addresses the core issue of ensuring compatibility with iPads and large projector screens, and it is more cost-effective.\n\n\n\n\nImproved user experience across different devices and screen sizes.\nIncreased versatility of the game, making it suitable for various applications.\nEnhanced navigation in 3D spaces.\nMore cost-effective solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential increase in development time and costs.\nAdditional resources for testing on different devices and screens.\n\n\n\n\nNavmeshes and 3D Navigation Points are tools used to define traversable spaces in a 3D environment.

This allows the team to focus on the core aspects of V-Sekai and achieve the goals more efficiently.\n\nMonitoring and Logging System Test:\n\nSetup logging framework\nConfigure monitoring system\nCreate a dashboard\n\nTest Environment with Simulated Data Test:\n\nCreate test scenarios\nGenerate simulated data\nConfigure test environment\nExecute test scenarios\nAnalyze test results\n\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEasier creation of V-Sekai.\nFocused development on core aspects.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nPotential overhead challenges.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nWaiting for Godot Engine 4.2 instead of assisting with 4.1 features.\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo. This is a process.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nThis is a core process for V-Sekai.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "Status: Proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\n\nTags: V-Sekai, Elixir, Membrane Framework, Multiplayer Blender, JSON-RPC\n\n\n\n\nThe current solution for handling multiplayer Blender has its limitations when it comes to scalability and real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose a new approach that leverages Elixir and the Membrane Framework. This will involve rewriting the code and introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner.\n\n\nIn this new approach, character posing will be handled in real-time and shared across multiple clients. This means that any changes made to a 3D model by one user will be immediately reflected on all other connected clients. This feature will enhance the collaborative experience and allow users to interact with the same 3D models simultaneously.\n\n\n\nThe state of the world, including objects, lighting, camera position, etc., will also be synchronized across all clients. This ensures that all users are experiencing the same environment, further enhancing the sense of immersion and collaboration.\n\n\n\nWe will introduce procedural generation techniques to create unique and dynamic environments. These generated worlds will be shared across all clients, ensuring that each user’s experience is not only immersive but also unique and engaging.\n\n\n\nAny drawings or annotations made using the Grease Pencil tool will be visible to all clients. This allows for collaborative sketching and planning, making it easier for teams to communicate their ideas visually.\n\n\n\nTo facilitate efficient communication with Blender, we’ll implement a JSON-RPC Blender runner. This will allow us to send commands to Blender and receive responses in a structured and standardized format. This feature will streamline the process of interacting with Blender, making it more efficient and user-friendly.\nBy implementing these features, we aim to improve the scalability and real-time performance of our multiplayer Blender solution. This will lead to a more immersive and collaborative experience for our users.\n\n\n\n\nThe main challenge is to translate the existing code into Elixir while maintaining the functionality and improving upon the limitations of the current system.

This simplifies the rendering process and reduces computational complexity.\nAirlocks: Use airlocks to translate the remote environment to the local environment. This allows for seamless interaction between different parts of the system while maintaining isolation and security.\n\n\n\n\nBy rewriting the code in Elixir, using the Membrane Framework, implementing the Khepri database library, introducing a JSON-RPC Blender runner, focusing on the use of triangles, and employing the “Airlocks” principles, we can expect improved scalability and real-time performance.

Establish a transparent and structured contribution process, including:\n\nCreate a centralized repository for documentation, code, and assets, with clear guidelines for contributing.\nDevelop a project roadmap with prioritized tasks, deadlines, and assigned responsibilities.\nImplement an onboarding process for new contributors, including tutorials, resources, and mentorship.\nOrganize regular meetings and communication channels for updates, progress reports, and collaboration.\nRecognize and reward contributors for their work, fostering a sense of community and commitment.\n\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nImproved collaboration and communication among the team\nAttracting more contributors with diverse skill sets\nFaster progress towards project milestones\nClear understanding of project goals and priorities\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nIncreased management and coordination overhead\nPotential for disagreements on priorities and approaches\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\n\nRelying on informal communication and ad-hoc collaboration\nContinuing with the current approach without a structured process\n\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nWhile it may be possible to work around some aspects of the problem with a few lines of script, it would not address the underlying issues of attracting and retaining contributors or improving collaboration. The proposed solution aims to create a more sustainable and efficient environment for the V-Sekai project, which cannot be achieved with a temporary workaround or a simple script.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nAs the primary developers of the project, the V-Sekai team has the best understanding of the project’s goals, objectives, and priorities. Implementing this feature in-house will ensure that the solution aligns well with the project’s vision and addresses the specific needs of the project.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nV-Sekai Roadmap and Goals\nV-Sekai Team Discussions and Updates\nMermaid.js"

This will allow for more realistic movements and prevent system errors when moving certain parts of the skeleton.\n\n\n\nThere may be potential challenges in implementing these constraints, particularly for the unsolved bones.

Aside from the Entity script being attached to the root node of a scene(?), and the scene itself being a node. Additionally, it may be necessary to query a node to find its containing entity (parent node). Note: Interaction between nodes within a single entity is considered an implementation detail of that entity and is out of the scope of the entity system. Any security model assumes that nodes cannot be transferred, shared or reparented between entities.\nEntities are objects known to the server and with explicit handling for state synchronization.\nSome entities may choose to synchronize little state, or position only, or no state at all. Also, some entities may choose to provide no security or isolation, while others may be private and appear not to even exist to other nodes. For example, a local player menu built upon the Entity System’s interaction features, gaining features A, D, F and G. By building this common framework, it means that systems built as Entities can be trivially synchronized over the network.\n\n\n\nTodo: We may want a way to optimistically spawn an entity client-side to achieve maximal responsiveness and fun.\nHowever, these entities will not yet know their server-side entity ID. Proposals: Reserve portion of ID space; or locally hold onto events/state and flush once the ID is known.\n\n\nThere will be a global directory of spawnable objects as part of a server connection. Players and maps can reference scenes by some name to spawn an entity with that name.\n\n\n\nEntities will have a server-assigned ID. Todo: What to do if an entity is spawned locally and an ID is not yet known.\n\n\n\nEntities will define a set of state variables that must be synced. The network protocol will take care of updating the state gradually over time, as well as rate-limiting. Events can be used to provide forced updates. Guarantees? Exposing metadata about when the state was updated?\nEntity properties:\n\nState that is synced is properties.\nSome properties are only assignable at spawn time (for example, scene file?)\nSome properties such as transform may require special handling.\n\nUpdate intervals:\nEntity refreshing / full state synchronization & serialization:\nDelta encoding & ACK protocol:\nWhen to use reliable events vs. “unreliable” (eventual) state synchronization: Events as a means for state synchronization.\n\n\n\nTODO: What classes / bespoke types exist? Examples: Physics, Physics Pickup; Button; Movable Platform; Vehicle\n\n\n\nConcepts:\nOwnership:\nAll entities will be owned by the player who interacts with them or by the server.\nEntity ownership will be transferred if the current owner leaves.\nMastership:\nMap entities may largely be mastered by a dedicated server.\nAvatar entities and props will be mastered by the player that spawned them, even if another player owns them.\n(Example: Alice personally spawns a ball avatar prop and throws it to Bob, who catches it. Alice has Mastership; Bob has Ownership.)\nMastership may be transferred on map exit; or they may be despawned (the player “takes” their props with them.)\nPrivacy: Entities may reveal very little state to the network. Are there cases where different players may be given different permissions?\nExample: Cooperative game, in which state is shared between some players but not others.\nExample: Team Melee\n\n\n\nScript-level guarantees that information about other entities is either restricted or absent entirely.\nIt may require a custom scripting language to achieve these guarantees fully.\n\n\n\nNot much to say here. We should see as little as possible built on top of pure Godot Nodes, except as a means for providing the entity’s functions.\n\n\n\nEntities will not be allowed to contain physics objects within the node hierarchy. Instead, physics objects must be attached to the entity in specific ways.\nQuestions: how does this work with PhysicalBone; how are physics objects linked to the entity; what about animations? (scale, rotation, skeleton attachments driving physical bodies?)\n\n\n\nMaps will have entities that might not be spawnable but will be automatically created and referenced within the parent scene.\nFor example, a button/door; or a state “god object”; or physics objects; built-in TV screens.\n\n\n\nMaps will provide a directory of map-spawnable scene references, which can be instantiated in response to events.\nThese will usually have specific functions within a particular map.\nExamples: Game-specific weapons; Keys; Buildings constructed\n\n\n\nPlayers may also provide a directory of avatar-spawnable scenes; Additionally, a prop database may exist or be negotiated.\nThese may include local UIs; weapons, pencils; media players; pets (parrots, mounts); vehicles; flight mechanics (wings?); visual effects.\n\n\n\nNodePath references (../) out of an entity hierarchy must be disallowed. Parenting should be implemented carefully: If nodes are literally parented to another entity (e.g. vehicles), NodePath references could expose implementation details from one entity to another entity.\nPart of a solution to this is to provide Attachment points as a feature of an Entity, but this needs to be implemented carefully to prevent unusual situations, for example, parent entity/node is destroyed (queue_free()) or removed from the scene tree (remove_child()); or animation paths referencing a node of the child entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibility of:\n\nvehicle games\nbow and arrow games\npickup of balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\n\n\nA networking system is not a few lines of code.\n\n\n\nYes, this is the foundation of the protocol and the basic set of nodes and behavior upon which content will be created.\n\n\n\nAldridge, David. “I Shot You First: networking the Gameplay of Halo: Reach”.

    "text": "Capturing accurate body movements with limited tracker placement\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: superseded by 20230602-limited-tracker-placement.md \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nIn our current VR project, we face the challenge of capturing accurate body movements for both soccer and dancing experiences with a limited budget. How can we prioritize the placement of a limited number of trackers to ensure a realistic and immersive experience for both activities?\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\nThe proposed option involves prioritizing tracker placement for the head, hands, hips, and feet, as they are essential for both soccer and dancing experiences. This approach allows for an effective trade-off between tracking accuracy and budget constraints while ensuring a satisfactory level of immersion in both activities.\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\n\nHead: At the base of the neck to monitor head rotation and tilt.\nLeft Hand: On the left wrist to track the overall motion of the left hand.\nRight Hand: On the right wrist to track the overall motion of the right hand.\nHips: A tracker on the hips to monitor lower body movement.\nLeft Foot: A tracker on the left foot to capture left foot movement, essential for both soccer and dancing.\nRight Foot: A tracker on the right foot to capture right foot movement, also crucial for both activities.\n\nAs the budget permits, additional trackers can be incorporated into the setup to further enhance tracking accuracy, particularly for the upper body and leg movements. This expansion can be achieved by following the prioritized list of additional trackers below:\n\nChest: A tracker on the chest to monitor upper body rotation, providing more detailed information about the user’s torso movements.\nLeft Shoulder: A tracker on the left shoulder to track upper arm rotation, allowing for more precise tracking of arm movements during soccer and dancing.\nRight Shoulder: A tracker on the right shoulder to track upper arm rotation, complementing the left shoulder tracker for better arm movement tracking.\nLeft Knee: A tracker on the left knee to track left leg movement, enhancing the realism of leg movements and providing more accurate feedback for actions like kicking in soccer or complex footwork in dancing.\nRight Knee: A tracker on the right knee to track right leg movement, mirroring the benefits of the left knee tracker for a balanced leg movement representation.\n\nBy gradually adding these trackers to the initial setup, the overall tracking accuracy of the system will be improved. This will result in more natural and immersive interactions within the VR environment, leading to a more satisfying user experience for both soccer and dancing activities.\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEffective use of a limited budget while maintaining immersive experiences.\nThe solution caters to both soccer and dancing activities in VR.\nFlexibility in adding more trackers as budget permits.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nReduced tracking accuracy for upper body and leg movements compared to a setup with more trackers.\nPotential limitations in supporting advanced features or interactions in VR.\n\n\n\nOption graveyard\nCamera-based tracking: Utilizing external cameras to track body movements without the need for wearable trackers. While this approach can be cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of accuracy and precision as wearable trackers, particularly for fast and complex movements in soccer and dancing. Additionally, camera-based tracking can be sensitive to lighting conditions and may require a specific setup to function optimally.\nCamera-based tracking might be a viable solution if budget constraints are severe, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability compared to wearable trackers.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nNo, as the proposed solution deals with hardware configuration and the strategic placement of physical trackers to balance budget and immersion.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nYes, ensuring an immersive VR experience with a limited budget is a fundamental challenge that requires expertise in tracker placement and prioritization.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai"

    "text": "Package Godot for pkgin\n\nMetadata\n\nStatus: proposed \nDeciders: V-Sekai,fire,\nTags: V-Sekai,chatgpt4,\n\n\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nAccording to Netflix, the BSD-type operating systems are competitive, and supporting pkgsrc is an excellent way to start.\n\npkgsrc is a framework for managing third-party software on UNIX-like systems containing over 26,000 packages. It is the default package manager of NetBSD and SmartOS and can be used to enable freely available software to be built quickly on a large number of other UNIX-like platforms.\n\n\nV-Sekai is developing a free, open-source virtual reality platform. We work to make it user-friendly and fulfill a need in the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nEffortless installation and updates: Packaging Godot Engine for pkgin makes it easier to install and update the software on macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, offering a smooth experience for users at all expertise levels.\nWider platform support: By embracing pkgsrc and packaging Godot Engine for pkgin, compatibility with an array of UNIX-like systems is ensured, broadening the user base and fostering adoption across different platforms.\nPromoting cooperation: V-Sekai’s support for pkgsrc and packaging of the Godot Engine for pkgin enables collaboration through the vast third-party software ecosystem available for UNIX-like systems, stimulating the exchange of ideas and resources.\nReinforcing open-source ideals: V-Sekai’s decision to package the Godot Engine for pkgin strengthens its commitment to open-source values like accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, enhancing growth within the VR community.\n\n\n\nDescribe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams\ngraph LR\nA[Godot Engine Source Code] --&gt; B[Build and Package]\nB --&gt; C[Godot Engine pkgin Package]\nC --&gt; D{Platform Compatibility}\nD --&gt; E[macOS]\nD --&gt; F[Linux]\nD --&gt; G[NetBSD]\nC --&gt; H[Package Repository]\nI[User] --&gt; J[pkgin command]\nJ --&gt; H\nH --&gt; K[Install/Update Godot Engine]\nK --&gt; I\n\n\nPositive Consequences\n\nEasy installation and updates: Pkgin support simplifies installing and updating the Godot Engine on UNIX-like systems, such as macOS, Linux, and NetBSD, providing a hassle-free experience for users.\nWide platform support: Pkgin compatibility ensures that the Godot Engine works seamlessly with multiple UNIX-like systems, expanding the user base and promoting adoption across various platforms.\nEfficient dependency handling: Pkgin automatically manages dependencies, streamlining the installation process and minimizing conflicts or issues due to unmet requirements.\nUniform software environment: Pkgin helps maintain consistency in software versions and configurations, which is crucial for collaboration and reducing the need for troubleshooting.\nConnection to the pkgsrc ecosystem: Supporting pkgin allows users to tap into the extensive third-party software ecosystem for UNIX-like systems, fostering the exchange of ideas and resources within the open-source community.\nResource and time savings: By offering pkgin support, developers can concentrate on enhancing the Godot Engine and V-Sekai’s VR platform features rather than manually managing software installations and updates.\nEmphasizing open-source principles: By endorsing pkgin, both V-Sekai and the Godot Engine reaffirm their commitment to open-source values, such as accessibility, transparency, and community-driven development, fostering growth and collaboration within the VR community.\n\n\n\nNegative Consequences\nThere are some potential downsides to packaging the Godot Engine for pkgin, which include:\nAdditional maintenance work: Supporting pkgin may necessitate regular package updates to ensure compatibility with different systems and to keep up with new Godot Engine versions and features. This could require extra time and resources from the development team.\nIncomplete platform support: Pkgin is designed for UNIX-like systems, but it doesn’t directly cater to users on other platforms, such as Windows. Supporting alternative package managers for non-UNIX platforms may demand extra efforts.\nUser learning curve: Users unfamiliar with pkgin or pkgsrc might need to invest time in learning to use the package manager effectively, which could pose a barrier for some users, particularly those new to UNIX-like systems or with limited package management experience.\nPotential compatibility challenges: While pkgin aims to provide compatibility across various UNIX-like systems, certain configurations or system setups may still pose difficulties. Addressing these issues might require more development and troubleshooting efforts.\nUnnecessary overhead for small projects: For smaller projects or users with minimal requirements, the added features and capabilities provided by pkgin support might be excessive. In such cases, the effort needed to maintain and use a pkgin package could outweigh its benefits.\nDespite these potential downsides, offering pkgin support can bring significant advantages, such as streamlining installation and updates, ensuring compatibility with UNIX-like systems, and promoting collaboration within the open-source community.\n\n\nOption graveyard\nAlternative package managers: While other package managers like apt or yum might have been considered, they may need to provide different compatibility with BSD-type systems than pkgsrc. Pkgin, designed for pkgsrc, is the default package manager for systems like NetBSD and SmartOS, making it the ideal choice.\nManual installation: Requiring users to compile and install Godot Engine manually would complicate the process and be less user-friendly, particularly for novices. This approach could also result in software version inconsistencies and configuration issues, affecting user experience.\nCustom package manager: Developing a custom package manager specifically for V-Sekai’s platform is resource-intensive and duplicates existing package managers’ efforts, such as pkgin, which already offers compatibility with BSD-type systems.\nExclusively focusing on other platforms: By targeting only Linux, macOS, or Windows, V-Sekai would limit its potential user base and overlook the advantages of supporting UNIX-like systems like NetBSD and SmartOS. So instead, packaging Godot Engine for pkgin enables V-Sekai to reach a wider audience using BSD-type operating systems.\n\n\nIf this enhancement will be used infrequently, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\nUsing a script for Godot Engine may have drawbacks, such as being less user-friendly, requiring more maintenance, having limited compatibility with BSD-type systems, and potentially impacting integration with the pkgsrc ecosystem.\n\n\nIs there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\nPackaging the Godot Engine for pkgin as a core task our team handles ensures quality control, streamlined support, customization, alignment with your platform’s vision, and trust-building with users. These factors contribute to the overall success and adoption of your open-source virtual reality platform.\n\n\nReferences\n\nV-Sekai\nhttps://pkgsrc.joyent.com/"

    "text": "Status: proposed\nDeciders: V-Sekai\nTags: V-Sekai, VR, Game Development\n\n\n\n\nWe have identified a limitation in the V-Sekai platform where there are too many variables to pose the kusudama constraints on the desktop. We propose to overcome this limitation by introducing a VR mode.\n\n\n\nOur solution involves creating a VR mode specifically for posing Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. The steps for implementation are as follows:\n\nTake an off the shelf VR controller.\nTake an off the shelf multiplayer functionality.\nDevelop a tool selection ui. Collaborate with guillefix.\nAdjust the kusudama constraint attributes to match posing.\nSave attributes.\n\n\n\nImagine you have a ball. There are two ways you can move it:\n\nTwist: Like spinning a globe on its stand.\nSwing: Like moving your finger from one spot to another on the ball.\n\nThink of a Kusudama (a type of origami that forms a sphere) as an example for the swing movement. The pieces of paper move just like your finger would on the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate Saracen’s VR networking prototype.\nRebuild character posing without tracking the physical sensors\nApply Many Bone IK tracking\nRotation swing (10x Vector4)\nRotation twist (From and range)\nAdjust for quality\nComplete configuration\n\nAssigning physical sensors to IK points is non-goal.\n\n\n\n\nDesktop Mode Enhancement: Initially, we considered enhancing the desktop mode to handle the kusudama constraints better. However, this option was discarded due to the inherent limitations of the desktop interface for such complex interactions.\nUse of External Tools: Another option was to use external tools or plugins specifically designed for handling Many Bone IK kusudama constraints. This option was rejected because it would require users to learn and manage additional software, which could lead to a fragmented user experience.\nSimplified Kusudama Constraints: We also thought about simplifying the kusudama constraints to make them more manageable on the desktop.

The steps for implementation are as follows:\n\nTake an off the shelf VR controller.\nTake an off the shelf multiplayer functionality.\nDevelop a tool selection ui. Collaborate with guillefix.\nAdjust the kusudama constraint attributes to match posing.\nSave attributes.\n\n\n\nImagine you have a ball. There are two ways you can move it:\n\nTwist: Like spinning a globe on its stand.\nSwing: Like moving your finger from one spot to another on the ball.\n\nThink of a Kusudama (a type of origami that forms a sphere) as an example for the swing movement. The pieces of paper move just like your finger would on the ball."

This option was rejected because it would require users to learn and manage additional software, which could lead to a fragmented user experience.\nSimplified Kusudama Constraints: We also thought about simplifying the kusudama constraints to make them more manageable on the desktop.

With the 2x2 grid, positioning and movement become crucial elements of strategy.\nBattle System Flow:\n\n1. Elysia selects an action (Move, Attack, Defend).\n2. LuminNet performs the selected action.\n3. The enemy reacts and counters.\n\n\nGrid-Based Combat\nOn the 2x2 grid, each cell can be occupied by either LuminNet or an enemy, or remain empty. LuminNet and enemies can move to any adjacent cell, attack enemies within range, or use abilities.\nHere’s an example of what the battlefield might look like:\nL = LuminNet\nE = Enemy\nX = Empty Cell\n\nLuminNet's Grid:\nL X\nX X\n“Cybernetic Charm” offers a unique blend of turn-based strategy and RPG elements, making each battle a test of both tactical skill and quick decision-making."

    "text": "Feature: Arc Menu for Spell Selection\nIn “Cybernetic Charm”, the character LuminNet has a variety of spells at her disposal. To make these spells easily accessible during combat, an arc menu feature is implemented.\n\nThe Arc Menu\nThe arc menu, also known as radial or pie menu, is a circular contextual menu where selection depends on direction. It’s a compact and efficient way of presenting multiple options, perfect for quick spell selection in the heat of battle.\nArc Menu Structure:\n\n1. Open Arc Menu (Press designated button)\n2. Navigate through Spells (Move joystick or cursor in the direction of the desired spell)\n3. Select Spell (Release button)\n\n\nSpell Selection\nWhen the character Elysia transforms into LuminNet, she gains access to her spell arsenal. These spells are categorized and arranged in the arc menu based on their type and power level. For example, defensive spells like shields and healing abilities might be grouped together, while offensive spells like energy blasts could be in another section.\nHere’s an example of what the arc menu might look like:\nArc Menu Layout:\n\n  Shield   Heal\n     \\     /\n      \\   /\nEnergy Blast\nEach spell in the arc menu has a unique icon and color coding for easy identification. Hovering over a spell reveals a tooltip with more information about the spell, such as its effects, range, and cooldown time.\nThis arc menu feature allows for quick, intuitive spell selection, adding another layer of strategy to the game’s combat system."

    "text": "Transitioning to Virtual Reality (VR)\nTransitioning “Cybernetic Charm” from a desktop game to a VR experience involves several adjustments to ensure an immersive and interactive gameplay. Here are some of the key changes required:\n\n1. User Interface (UI) Adjustments\nIn VR, the UI needs to be more intuitive and less intrusive. The arc menu, for instance, can be transformed into a 3D radial menu that appears around the player’s hand when activated.\nVR Arc Menu Activation:\n\n1. Player raises their hand (or controller).\n2. Arc menu materializes around the hand.\n3. Player selects spell by pointing in the direction of the desired spell.\n4. Spell is selected upon release.\n\n\n2. Spatial Awareness and Movement\nIn VR, players have a full 360-degree view of their surroundings. This means the 2x2 grid combat system will need to be adapted to allow for movement in all directions.\nVR Grid-Based Combat:\n\n1. Player physically moves to navigate LuminNet on the grid.\n2. Hand gestures or controller inputs are used for actions like attack or defend.\n3. Enemies react and counter in real-time.\n\n\n3. Enhanced Spell Casting\nSpell casting in VR can be more interactive. Instead of selecting a spell from a menu, players can perform specific hand gestures or movements to cast spells.\nVR Spell Casting:\n\n1. Player performs a specific gesture or movement.\n2. LuminNet casts the corresponding spell.\n3. The effect of the spell is immediately visible in the VR environment."

The gameplay is asymmetric, meaning each player has unique abilities and goals.\n- **Player 1 (Defender)**: This player's role is to protect their assets and achieve certain goals. They use their turns to build barriers (represented by tokens or cards) on their 4x4 grid and accumulate resources. Each square on their board could represent a location they need to safeguard.\n\n- **Player 2 (Attacker)**: This player's role is to breach the defender's barriers and disrupt their plans. They use their turns to develop their tools (also represented by tokens or cards), examine the defender's barriers, and initiate breaches. Their 4x4 grid could represent different types of actions or tools they can utilize.\n\n- **Interaction**: The game could involve a lot of strategic deception and deduction, as the defender tries to mislead the attacker about where their most valuable locations are, and the attacker tries to figure out where to breach. Actions that affect the opponent's board could be incorporated into the gameplay.\n\n- **Winning Condition**: The game ends when the defender achieves a certain number of goals, or when the attacker accumulates enough points by successfully breaching the defender's locations.\nThis design maintains the resource management and strategic planning elements of many strategy games, but adds a layer of direct conflict and asymmetry."

We started with a dream to build an open-source VR tech stack using the Godot Engine, a popular open-source game engine. Our goal was not only to contribute to the social VR space but also to provide alternatives to proprietary engines like Unity and Unreal.\nWe’ve worked on many projects for Godot, including support for the VRM virtual character model format, an importer for Unitypackage content, systems for IK and character animation retargeting, more robust networking solutions, a WebAssembly-based scripting engine, improvements to Godot’s VR support, and much more.\nOur journey had its challenges. For instance, our booth at Virtual Market 6, one of the world’s largest virtual conventions, was removed two days after opening due to alleged violations of VRChat, Inc.’s terms of service. But this setback only strengthened our resolve and highlighted the need for open solutions in the social VR space.\nToday, V-Sekai has grown into a global community of open technology enthusiasts who are committed to advancing open standards and open-source software for virtual worlds. We continue to welcome others who share our values to join us and contribute to the future of open-source VR technology.\nJoin V-Sekai, our open-source VR group on Discord!\n\n\n\nChat: On Discord.\nVisit: v-sekai.org.\nFollow: Us on Twitter.\nContribute: On GitHub here.\nTrack: Proposals here.\nOrganize: Issues here.\nContact: SaracenOne, Lyuma, or Fire."

Key developments include the implementation of WebAssembly modules for Godot Engine 4, improvements to the V-Sekai Godot Engine fork, and advancements in Unidot’s FBX humanoid support. Additionally, there were updates to the manual site, suggestions for Blender VRM drag-and-drop support, and bug fixes related to LODs.\n\nhttps://github.com/ashtonmeuser/godot-wasm/tree/godot-4 Implements wasm modules for Godot Engine 4.\nFire has chatgpt4 api access.\nMerged godot-wasm into V-Sekai Godot Engine fork for experimenting with user generated scripting and optimization of computation.\nvsk_speech branch of V-Sekai Godot Engine passes cicd again!!\nRevised and optimized the manual site.\nSuggested that .VRM drag and drop support is added to Blender. https://github.com/mika-f/blender-drag-and-drop/issues/34#issuecomment-1539429579\nUse a better representation of feminine and masculine avatars\nFixing bugs with lods\n\n\n\nLyuma has been working on implementing imported humanoid FBX support in Unidot, including bone guessing. The current implementation supports FBX source models and performs bone name guessing when humanDescription is empty. However, it does not yet support humanoid .anim clips, and there are known issues applying Animator components to already-imported models.\nAfter fixing a typo in Fix Silhouette, Lyuma reported that FBX humanoid animation import in Unidot seems much closer. They also implemented support for “Copy from other Avatar” to handle conversion of Maya FBX files with the first frame posed like the animation. This allows using the T-pose of another model as the rest pose.\nLyuma shared their progress on Twitter, showcasing the effectiveness of Unidot-Importer by VSekaiOfficial and Godot 4.0’s new humanoid retargeter system. The Godot Engine community also discovered the team’s GLTF work, as seen in a tweet by Bramwell.\nGamefromscratch covered Godot -&gt; Unity migration in a YouTube video, highlighting the use of barcoderdev’s version of FBX2glTF with Unidot, which might solve the pivot issue encountered earlier."

This will allow for faster processing and better performance while maintaining human-readability."

FlatBuffers provide a more efficient way to serialize and deserialize data compared to standard JSON while still being human-readable.\nThis feature should be part of the core engine to ensure official support and seamless integration.\nUse the extension FBJSCN."
