# Draft: Update V-Sekai Charter to 2024

## The Context

The Mozilla Builders Summer MVP Lab charter was submitted on June 8, 2020. It's now time to refresh our goals and direction.

## The Problem Statement

Our current V-Sekai charter is outdated and needs to be revised to reflect the project's current state and future ambitions in 2024.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

**A one-line summary of the MVP:**

A customizable and self-hosted virtual reality environment built on Godot Engine.

**Description of the product: What will the MVP be in 8 weeks?**

Our virtual reality app will be compatible with all SteamVR-compatible PC headsets and the Meta Quest VR platform. It will feature a social hub with 3D voice chat, real-time body tracking, simple games, integrated physics, and social video viewing.

**Category:**

- Decentralized Web: YES
- Messaging & Social Networking: YES

**Why does your idea matter? How will it help deliver on the full promise of the internet or make the internet more awesome?**

The internet thrives on openness and communication. We believe virtual reality is a powerful new medium for human connection. With the closure of platforms like High Fidelity, open-source alternatives are crucial to counter the trend of closed VR platforms.

VR technology is advancing rapidly. Better game engines, audio and video codecs, faster internet speeds, and more accessible VR hardware create the perfect opportunity to develop an open platform.

We champion individual empowerment through decentralized technology. Our goal is to build a polished and functional service that integrates decentralized authentication and encryption, along with content distribution technologies like BitTorrent and IPFS.

**Who are your users or potential users?**

Our target audience includes users of social VR experiences, online collaboration tools, and communication products. The social VR space is growing, and its potential is just beginning to be explored.

Despite being a relatively new technology, VR has a large potential market, particularly with the rise of affordable headsets like Meta Quest. For example, VRChat boasts between 12,000 and 15,000 concurrent users, with approximately 4,000 using VR in 2019.

**What is your connection to the service & the user group you plan to reach with your product?**

We are a team of VR enthusiasts with backgrounds in visual effects, level design, and graphics.

In an era where remote connection is essential, VR offers a more immersive and engaging way to bring people together compared to traditional video calls. One of our team members has participated in Virtual Market 4, a growing virtual content marketplace.

Through other social VR platforms, we have connected with people worldwide, attended live events, and formed meaningful friendships. We aim to provide these experiences in an open and accessible environment.

**Will your team still work on this project if we do not fund it? To what extent?**

We are committed to this project and will continue development regardless of funding. However, external funding would significantly accelerate our progress and help us stay competitive with closed VR platforms that are rapidly evolving.

**Why did you pick this idea? Would you happen to have domain expertise? How do you know people need what youâ€™re building?**

We recognize the need for an open alternative to closed VR platforms. Many current platforms are free, but there's no guarantee they will remain that way. Our platform offers the advantages of self-hosting, private use, and modification.

Our team possesses expertise in backend operations and Godot Engine development, both essential for building this platform.

**Are you looking for any teammates? If so, please indicate what skills or roles you seek.**

We welcome new contributors! We have a Discord group, a GitHub repository, and an issues list where individuals can learn about the project and find ways to contribute.

**Could you describe your work plan?**
