### Proposal Title

Use MaterialX for gltf2 chair asset interchange

### Context and Problem Statement

Use MaterialX for asset interchange

### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

I was challenged to assemble a green IKEA chair with MaterialX https://github.com/KhronosGroup/3DC-Certification/tree/main/models/GreenChair by humbletim.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams

1. bake materialx
2. add gltf2 extension
3. create an IO/Blender
4. create an IO/Godot

### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

This is so complicated.

### Positive Consequences

_No response_

### Negative Consequences

_No response_

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

I am championing this workflow.
