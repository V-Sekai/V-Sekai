# Draft: Discord on the Sidequest

## The Context

V-Sekai users may want to communicate with others outside of VR, even if those other people aren't in VR. This could be for several reasons, such as coordinating meetups, discussing development, or simply staying socially connected.

## The Problem Statement

Currently, V-Sekai users lack a convenient way to communicate with people outside of VR while still immersed in the V-Sekai experience. This can lead to a fragmented social experience and limit the potential for collaboration and community building.

## Describe how your proposal will work with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

This proposal suggests using Discord on the Quest 3 alongside V-Sekai. This would allow users to access Discord features, such as text chat and voice channels.

1.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Before you begin, you'll need to enable Developer Mode on your Quest 3.
2.  **Install Sidequest:** Users would first need to install the Sidequest app on their VR device. Sidequest is a platform that allows users to sideload apps and modifications onto their VR headsets.
3.  **Install Aliucord:** Next, users would install the Aliucord app, via Sidequest. https://sidequestvr.com/app/38748/aliucord-installer-simplified-setup-for-enhanced-discord
4.  **Access Discord in VR:** Once installed, users can access Discord through the Horioznos interface within their VR headset. This would allow them to view their Discord channels, send and receive messages, share the display and participate in voice chats.
5.  **Run Discord side-by-side with V-Sekai:** Users can use the multitasking feature of the Quest 3 to run Discord alongside V-Sekai, allowing them to communicate with others outside of VR without interrupting their V-Sekai experience.

## The Benefits

-   **Enhanced Communication:** Users can stay connected with friends and colleagues outside of VR without having to leave the V-Sekai environment.
-   **Community Building:** Facilitates communication and collaboration among V-Sekai users and the wider Discord community.
-   **Accessibility:** Leverages existing tools and platforms, making it relatively easy to implement and access.

## The Downsides

-   **Dependence on External Platform:** Relies on a third-party platform (Discord).
-   **Potential Performance Issues:** Running Discord within VR could potentially impact performance on some devices.
-   **User Interface Challenges:** The Discord interface may present some challenges in terms of usability and accessibility within VR.

## The Road Not Taken

Developing a custom communication system within V-Sekai was considered. However, leveraging existing platforms like Discord offers a more immediate and resource-efficient solution.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While Discord integration would benefit many users, those who primarily interact with other V-Sekai users within VR might not find it as essential.

## Why is it in Core and done by us?

This proposal aligns with our core goal of fostering a vibrant and connected community. By enabling seamless communication with the wider world, we can enhance the social experience within V-Sekai. We will implement this as it involves integrating with existing platforms and aligns with our expertise.
