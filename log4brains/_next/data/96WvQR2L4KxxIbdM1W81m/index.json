That way, you can become familiar with the whole project history just by reading its decision log in chronological order.\nMoreover, maintaining this documentation aims at:\n\n- üöÄ Improving and speeding up the onboarding of a new team member\n- üî≠ Avoiding blind acceptance/reversal of a past decision (cf [Michael Nygard's famous article on ADRs](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html))\n- ü§ù Formalizing the decision process of the team\n\n## Usage\n\nThis website is automatically updated after a change on the `master` branch of the project's Git repository.\nIn fact, the developers manage this documentation directly with markdown files located next to their code, so it is more convenient for them to keep it up-to-date.\nYou can browse the ADRs by using the left menu or the search bar.\n\nThe decision process is entirely collaborative and backed by pull requests.\n\nProposals are committed files: then there is no issue or PR, and the discussion thread, if any, exists on the Discussions tab.\n\nWe do not want ephemeral prs in an limbo state which is not on master branch, for an undefined times.\n\nWe do not want discussions to occur only while the proposal is in the PR state and the discussion is then forgotten when it gets \"merged\" to master.\n\nFor each proposal, create a discussion thread. Then, at the bottom or the top of the proposal, link to the discussion\n\n## About V-Sekai\n\nV-Sekai is the first fully-open source social VR platform running on the Godot Engine. It is designed as a living virtual space where you can meet people and interact in a virtual space, while leveraging the fast-growing Godot game engine to let users create any content they want and have it be immediately accessible and shareable to a growing community.\n\n## Why V-Sekai?\n\nWe believe social VR should be a truly community-driven experience. For this to be realised, we believe the entire software stack should be available, moddable, and tweakable from the source up, in order to ensure V-Sekai develops into the best platform it can possibly be.\n\n## Who are we?\n\nWe are a small group of developers and VR enthusiasts who felt there was a need for a project like this. Many of us already love the existing offerings out there, but wanted our own self-sustainable platform which could survive on the backs of its community, rather than being tied to the life of a company and a small group of individuals with exclusive control over its direction.\n\n## What do we offer?\n\nWe have built a framework for the Godot game engine which makes the distribution of custom avatars and worlds in a networked environment possible. Our current plan is to offer hosting via our own web server, as well as individual server hosting and social functions, and in the future plan to broaden what we can offer. We have already been tackling many of the technical challenges required to make such a project possible on the Godot game engine, including:\n\n* Spatialised audio and VOIP support\n* Native VRM support\n* Our own custom networking stack\n* A security-focused sandboxed scripting environment backed by WASM\n* Customisable servers with their own individual game rules\n\n## Alright, when can we get it?\n\nAt the moment, we have functional prototypes, but are still deep in development. We have slowly been offering download keys to a small group of private volunteering testers. We want to ensure that our formal release is as polished as it can be.\n\nRegister now to reserve your name and to receive updates on future beta participation.\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter for updates on the project.\n\nIf you're interested in developing for Godot Engine, chatting about anything or learning more, contact any of us directly.
