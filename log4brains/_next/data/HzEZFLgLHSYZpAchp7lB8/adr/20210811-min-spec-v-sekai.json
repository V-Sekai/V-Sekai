Achieve 16.67 milliseconds (60 FPS) frame time on a 4k screen for V-Sekai in desktop flat mode.\n2. The 16.67 milliseconds target should be achieved smoothly and not as the average.\n\n### Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation\n\nWe want to create a standard test platform for V-Sekai to get performance data.\n\n1.  Canonical test/reference hardware by platform (desktop-flat, desktop-vr, mobile-vr)\n2.  Canonical content by platform (avatar+map): both low end (Mozilla Hubs + static avatars) and mid-end and high-end\n\n### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, and/or diagrams\n\nSpecify a minimum specification.\n\n1. Single Board Computers UDOO BOLT GEAR - kit based on UDOOBOLT V8 with metallic case.\n\nThis is the computer we think is the most similar to a Valve Steamdeck.\n\n2. Solid State Drives - SSD 1 TB\n3. Memory Modules \"NCNR\" 260pin SODIMM ECC DDR4 2666 16GB1.2v 1Gx8(0-85)\nWe use ECC to during testing avoid \"Godbolts\" from the universe.\n4. Windows 10 operating system\nWindows 10 is what typical PCVR uses.\n5. Popos! 20.04 operating system\nPopos! Linux is similar to the Arch Linux that Steam Deck uses.\n\n\nUse a scripted fly through demo.\n\n1. https://github.com/Calinou/godot-cmvalley\n2. https://github.com/TokageItLab/3d-platform-test-for-godot4\n3. An animated camera can be exported from Blender.\n1. Record performance data in .res format and also json.\n2. Record OBS videos of the fly through with frametime and stats.\n\n### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?\n\nNot coding related.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n_No response_\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n1. Only represent AMD APUs.\n2. Hardware is fairly new. Only a few years old.\n3. Steam Deck uses quad-channel DDR5 instead of dual-channel DDR4, and also DLNA2 instead of Vega graphics\n\n### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?\n\nAs a platform holder, it would be our responsibility to understand the limits of the platform.\n\n### References\n\n- UDOO Bolt\n[datasheet_udoo_bolt_gear-1947342.pdf](https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-proposals/files/6958673/datasheet_udoo_bolt_gear-1947342.pdf)\n- [Mouser Electronics Canada V-Sekai Platform.pdf](https://github.com/V-Sekai/v-sekai-proposals/files/6958676/Mouser.Electronics.Canada.V-Sekai.Platform.pdf)\n- https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-perf/\n\n\n\n### Derivative License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 V-Sekai contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
