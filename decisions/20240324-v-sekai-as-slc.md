# Propose: Implementation of V-Sekai as SLC

## Context

In the realm of VR gaming, providing a cohesive and welcoming experience is critical. A VR dating game can capitalize on this by adhering to principles of simplicity, engagement, and completeness.

## Problem Statement

The challenge lies in designing a VR dating game that's intuitive for newcomers, engaging to keep users hooked, and offers a full-feature set from launch without relying on subsequent updates or add-ons.

## Proposal Details

Using the SLC framework—Simple, Lovable, Complete—the project should:

- **Simple:** Focus on user-friendly design with clear instructions and easy navigation.

  ```pseudo
  function interact_with_object(object):
      if object.is_interactable:
          show_prompt("Press X to interact")
          wait_for_input()
          execute_interaction()
  ```

- **Lovable:** Create appealing characters and environments that enhance the virtual dating experience.

- **Complete:** Launch with a comprehensive set of features such as diverse scenarios and in-depth character interactions.

  ```yaml
  launch_features:
    - CompleteCharacterCustomization
    - DiverseScenarios
    - InDepthCharacterInteractions
    - RealTimeChat
  ```

## Benefits

This approach ensures a product that's accessible, captivating, and satisfying without the need for immediate expansion, catering to a wide audience.

## Downsides

A more extensive initial development phase may delay the release, and an emphasis on simplicity could potentially limit advanced functionalities.

## Alternate Approach

Opting for a leaner initial version might allow for an earlier release but could also risk losing early adopters if their expectations are not met.

## Consideration for Infrequent Users

Design a user-friendly re-engagement process ensuring that returning users can easily resume and understand new features.

## Development Philosophy

Focus on core features essential at launch, with the possibility of expanding based on user feedback.
