### Metadata

- Status: proposed <!-- draft | proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by -->
- Deciders: V-Sekai,
- Tags: V-Sekai,


### Context and Problem Statement

We can do search and similarity with embedding databases.

### Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

I want to see what applications we can use do when we convert godot engine packed scenes to embeddings.

### Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

When the user presses launches the game, there should be no unecessary steps.

### Positive Consequences

We can store embeddings.

### Negative Consequences

We don't have a good way to convert to embeddings yet.

### Option graveyard

- Option: The status quo. <!-- List the proposed options no longer open for consideration. -->
- Rejection Reason: This solves nothing. <!-- List the reasons for the rejection: (the bad traits) -->


### If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not a few lines of script.

### Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

This is probably not core unless we want to do search and annotations.
